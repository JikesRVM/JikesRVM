# target OS is Linux

# NOTE: the key requirement for setting this to 0 (ie having SMP support)
#       is that you have a 2.4 kernel and that glibc is compiled 
#       to use the GS segment register to access pthread-local storage.  
#       See discussion in rvm-researchers archive and the userguide FAQ.
#  This is now quite common. For example, in Red Hat 7 and later.  
#  So, the default is 0
