# This file defines a set of environment variables needed to build and
# run Jikes RVM.  This file is sourced by the installation scripts; you
# do not need to source this file into your command-prompt shell.
#
# This is the default file for writing the boot image with the Kaffe VM.
#
# IMPORTANT: You might need to modify this file to reflect your environment!
#	To see how we do that at IBM Watson, take a look at
#	 i686-pc-linux-gnu.kaffe.watson
#
#    To learn about more of the fancy configuration options, read
#		config/i686-pc-linux-gnu

#########
# PART I: Preprocessor directives that hold for every config on this target
#
# If you're using Debian GNU/Linux with a 2.2 or 2.4 kernel, then 
# you'll want to enable RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR.  Otherwise, 
# you should not need to change anything in this section.
#########
# target architecture is Intel x86 (IA32)
export RVM_FOR_IA32=1
export RVM_FOR_32_ADDR=1

# The target OS kernel is Linux
export RVM_FOR_LINUX=1

# NOTE: the key requirement for setting this to 0 (ie having SMP support)
#       is that you have a 2.4 kernel and that glibc is compiled 
#       to use the GS segment register to access pthread-local storage.  
#	(Another way of saying this is that glibc is compiled to 
#	 handle "floating stacks").
#       See the FAQ in the Jikes RVM User's Guide.
#
#       This is now quite common. For example, in Red Hat 7 and later.  
#       So, the default is 0.  The Big Exception is if you are using Debian
#       GNU/Linux with a 2.4 or 2.2 kernel.  Debian with a 2.6 kernel will 
#	work, but it won't work with a 2.4 or 2.2 kernel.
#
[[ $RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR ]] || export RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR=0
## Use this for Debian GNU/Linux with a Linux 2.4 kernel, 
## and for any Linux 2.2 kernel:
# export RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR=1

export BOOTIMAGE_LOAD_ADDRESS=0x43000000
export MAXIMUM_MAPPABLE_ADDRESS=0xc0000000

##########
# PART II: Where to find tools and resources on this target
#
# This configuration makes use of auto-guessing features in the 
# RVM_ROOT/rvm/bin/jconfigure program.  You can see the results of its 
# guesses in "RVM_BUILD/environment.host".    
########## 

# Selection of GNU Classpath version is platform independent and fairly
# involved; therefore it has been factored out into a separate file.
. $RVM_ROOT/rvm/config/classpath-version

HOST_VM_TYPE=Kaffe
# HOST_VM_TYPE=Sun
# HOST_VM_TYPE=JikesRVM

# If you have Kaffe anywhere other than in /usr/local/kaffe, please
# uncomment the line below and set it appropriately.
# export KAFFE_HOME="/usr/local/kaffe"

## You can learn about other configuration options by reading the
## i686-pc-linux-gnu file, which documents all of them.  You probably won't
## need to set most of them.

##########
# PART III: Additional variables for running Eclipse on Jikes RVM
#
# Unless you want to run Eclipse, ignore this section.
########## 
# These are used only by the jbuild.plugin build script.

export ANT_CMD=/opt/jakarta-ant-1.5.3/bin/ant

export ECLIPSE_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/eclipse-2.1"

##########
# PART IV: Miscellaneous variables.
#
# If you add any variables to this section, please document them.  Please.
##########

# BENCHMARK_ROOT is used in running some of the Jikes RVM regression
# tests.  It doesn't need to be set unless you are running those tests.
#

# NOTE: The regression test infrastructure still hasn't been adapted
# to Kaffe.  There may be some glitches as you do this.
