V maxSystemTroubleRecursionDepth int  3
If we get deeper than this in one of the System Trouble functions, try to die.


# NOTE: Although this option can be set to arbitrary values,
#       setting it to a smaller quantum than what is actually supported
#       by pthread nanosleep on the target platform will reduce the
#       effectiveness of the Adaptive System.  Therefore, this setting
#       should be verified by running a relatively long running program
#       on an unload machine and enabling -X:aos:reportInterruptStats=true
V interruptQuantum int (VM.BuildForLinux&&VM.BuildForIA32)?20:10
Timer interrupt scheduling quantum in ms


V schedulingMultiplier int 1
Scheduling quantum = interruptQuantum * schedulingMultiplier


V TraceThreadScheduling int 0 traceThreadScheduling

V VerboseStackTracePeriod int 0 verboseStackTrace
Trace every nth time a stack trace is created


V EdgeCounterFile String null edgeCounterFile
Input file of edge counter profile data


V CBSCallSamplesPerTick int 8
How many CBS call samples (Prologue/Epilogue) should we take per time tick


V CBSCallSampleStride int 2
Stride between each CBS call sample (Prologue/Epilogue) within a sampling window


V CBSMethodSamplesPerTick int 0
How many CBS method samples (any yieldpoint) should we take per time tick


V CBSMethodSampleStride int 3
Stride between each CBS method sample (any yieldpoint) within a sampling window


V TuningForkTraceFile String null tfTraceFile
Filename to use for TuningFork trace generation


V forceOneCPU int -1
