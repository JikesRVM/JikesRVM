This is release 2.1.1 of the Jikes RVM. The main purpose of
this release is bug fixes.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We are aware of a bug in the IBM DK for 
  Linux/IA32 v1.3.1 when building Jikes RVM.  Stick with 
  version v1.3.0 until this bug can be resolved.

Highlights of this release include:
 - Introduction of a new method-level runtime exception 
   pragma mechanism, contributed by Chapman Flack.  The 
   system now relies on this mechanism for method-level 
   pragmas for uninterruptibility and inlining directives.
 - Stricter enforcement of uninterruptibility rules.
 - Improvements to SSA optimization package to reduce 
   register pressure.  These changes make O2 profitable
   for use by the adaptive system on IA32.

NOTE: VM_Magic.pragmaInline and VM_Magic.pragmaNoInline 
are deprecated, and will not be supported in the 2.1.2 
release.  Migrate code to use the new runtime exception
pragma mechanism.

To see more details on other miscellaneous bug fixes, see
