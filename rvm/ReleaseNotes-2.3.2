These are release notes for Jikes RVM release 2.3.2.

*Sections of this document:
 *Highlights
 *Other Notes
 *Bug Fixes

*Highlights of this release include:

**64-bit port of baseline compiler and runtime system to PowerPC64/AIX is 
complete. We have been passing all regression tests on PPC64/AIX for
over a month. NOTE: porting of the optimizing compiler has not yet begun
(contributions/collaborations welcome) and therefore no configuration
with the optimizing compiler will work in 64 bit mode.

** The default GC plan for the prototype, prototype-opt, development, 
and production configurations has been changed from CopyMS to GenMS. 
GenMS is a generational collector with an Appel-style nursery and a 
mark-sweep mature space.

**Source Code editing support
There are now VIM and Emacs style files supporting the Jikes RVM coding
style for C, Java, and C++.  See rvm/etc/README.  (This should have
been in the 2.3.1 release announcement but was not.)

**You can build Jikes RVM entirely with open-source tools.
You can now build Jikes RVM using the Kaffe virtual machine.  Details
in the installation section in the user's guide. 

*Other notes:

**Performance improvements in VM_Memory copying routines used by 
System.arraycopy and copying GC resulted in 10% improvement in
SPECjbb2000 throughput. 

*Bug Fixes:
** Fixed problems in alignment support in JMTk that were causing crashes
in GC on PowerPC/AIX when doubleword alignment of long[] and double[]
was enabled. This is a bug that was introduced in version 2.3.1 and is
fixed in 2.3.2.

** Fixed performance problem in profile-directed inlining where the 
AI Organizer forces recompilation of methods in an attempt to inline
runtime service routines that won't be inlined no matter how many
times we try.  Problem has always existed, but became much more severe
in 2.3.0 release when we disabled the inlining of allocation sequences
if the size of the object was not known at compile time.

** Fixed bug in which non-virtualizable interface calls where not being
considered as candidates for feedback-directed inlining.
