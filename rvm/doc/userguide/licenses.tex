This section discusses the licensing for Jikes\TMweb{} RVM and for
any distribution that combines \jrvm{} with its usual class
libraries,
\xlink{GNU Classpath}{\classpathURL}.

IBM does not distribute GNU Classpath, nor does IBM distribute
\jrvm{} combined with GNU Classpath, but there does not appear to be
any problem with others doing so.

One of the project's core team members intends
to distribute a \xlink{Debian\Rboth{} GNU/Linux}{\DebianURL} package that
contains a pre-built \jrvm{}, including the compiled GNU Classpath
libraries.  We encourage you to make a package or other distribution
for your favorite operating system that runs Jikes RVM.
