 Version 2.2.1 of Jikes RVM is the first release that purports to run
\xlink{Eclipse}{\eclipseURL}; this is really a technology preview and
for that reason we start with some caveats, the most obvious being
that any attempt at production-mode use of Eclipse with Jikes RVM
would be very silly. Furthermore:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do even attempt to try this unless you are running a
recent---7.3 or newer---version of RedHat Linux for Intel IA32. 
\item Use only BaseBase* and *Adaptive* Jikes RVM builds when trying
to run Eclipse.  The *Opt* images have terrible performance, and are
the most likely to trip over bugs.
\item Use only the *SemiSpace builds of Jikes RVM.  We have seen
various limitations of the other collectors, such as severe
fragmentation and implementation-specific resource limits.
\item Use only the Eclipse builds for Linux and GTK.  There are builds
for Linux and Motif, but we never test these and work on Eclipse seems
to focus on the GTK version.
\item We strongly recommend Eclipse 2.1 versions, currently the latest
stable builds from \xlink{{\tt \eclipseURL}}{\eclipseURL}.  Eclipse
2.0.x releases may also work.
\item The Eclipse debugging support for Java programs---which relies
on talking JDWP to the vm---will certainly not work, since there is no
debugging support in Jikes RVM.
\end{itemize}

 Given these caveats, Eclipse has been running on Jikes RVM at
Watson in various configurations since the summer of 2002, and
more-or-less all of the standard Eclipse functionality appears to work
(The single biggest exception is debugging support, as mentioned
above).  We have successfully developed and run Java programs, checked
projects out of CVS repositories, used the refactoring support, run
the Web-based help system, applied updates to Eclipse, and so on.
Furthermore, performance is generally not too bad, at least when
adaptive builds of Jikes RVM are used.  Most importantly, we very much
want people outside to try running Eclipse on Jikes RVM: we eagerly
solicit feedback regarding bugs and would be especially grateful for
any contributions that enhance the usability of Eclipse on Jikes RVM.  

 Setting up Eclipse and Jikes RVM is relatively straightforward; you
have to install Jikes RVM and Eclipse themselves first, and, after
that, there are just a few steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install Ant---the Java-based build tool.  You can get this from
\xlink{{\tt \antURL}}{\antURL}. 
\item Add two variables to your Jikes RVM configuration file:
 \begin{description}
 \item[ANT\_CMD] is the full pathname of the executable Ant command
 \item[ECLIPSE\_INSTALL\_DIR] is the root of your Eclipse install
 \end{description}
\item In a fresh build directory, run ./jbuild.plugin to install
support for Eclipse to use Jikes RVM
\end{enumerate}

 Once you have done this, you will be able to run Eclipse on Jikes RVM
using the {\tt RVM\_ROOT/rvm/bin/rvmeclipse} command.  This wrapper
calls the normal Eclipse command, instructing it to use Jikes RVM to
run Eclipse.  You must have RVM\_ROOT and RVM\_BUILD set whenever you
invoke {\tt rvmeclipse}.
