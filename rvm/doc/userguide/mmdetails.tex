This section provides additional information on the implementation
of the memory management component of Jikes\trademark RVM runtime system.

Version 2.2.0 of Jikes RVM introduces JMTk, a new family of memory
managers. JMTk is described in the next section. A few of the original
watson collectors are still included in Jikes RVM 2.2.1 but are
scheduled for removal shortly.  Only the Semispace and
MarkSweep watson collectors have been regularly tested.
