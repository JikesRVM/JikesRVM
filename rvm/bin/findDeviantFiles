# Three parameters:
#   target directory
#   source directory where to put output files
#   suffix to identify output files	
#
# This script could be more efficiently implemented by searching for all 
# the missing information at the same time; however, we would not know

Usage: $ME <input-subtree> <output-directory> [ <suffix> ]
  or:  $ME --help
   
  Where 
    <input-subtree>	identifies the directory subtree to search for files, 
    <output-directory>	indicates where to put output files, and
    <suffix>		is a file extension appended to the output files.

  This script finds all files in a directory subtree 
  that don't contain either:
    1) an @author javadoc tag, 
    2) a copyright notice, or
    3) an \$Id: tag.

  Output files:

    "<output-directory>/noAuthors[.<suffix>]"
	      Names of files without the @author tag
    "<output-directory>/noCopyright[.<suffix>]"   
	      Names of files without a copyright notice
    "<output-directory>/noId[.<suffix>]"   
	      Names of files without an \$Id: tag.

shopt -s nullglob
### XXX This array version breaks due to what I believe is a bug in
### Bash, whereby the expression '*~' is being expanded in the calls
### to `find' (at least, it is being expanded whenever it might be.)
### OK, this is a bug in BASH version "2.05a.0(1)-release".  
### The manual page clearly states: "the special pattern characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally".

## Turn off the globbing.  This works in all BASH versions.
set -f
## Redundant with above
set -o noglob

## Make sure ! is not magic.  This really doesn't help, thought, since Bash
## defines '!' as a reserved word.
## Oddly, bash gripes even when the reserved words are quoted.  How odd.
