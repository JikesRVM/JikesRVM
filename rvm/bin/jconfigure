## There is a bug in BASH version 2.05b.0(1)-release
## (BASH_VERSINFO=([0]="2" [1]="05b" [2]="0" [3]="1" [4]="release" [5]="i386-redhat-linux-gnu"))
## whereby we are getting complaints that the variable "midline" was
## used before being set.  Specifically:
##
##   $ jconfigure NoSuch
##   /homes/bilbo/augart/JikesRVM/Clean/rvm/bin/jconfigure: line 320: midline: unbound variable
##
## The complaint actually refers to line 320 of libjconfigure.bash.
## And the workaround below solves it.  The bug is not present in Bash
## 2.05a.0(1)-release 
## --Steve Augart

# ## Debugging code in case we have the weird problem again:
# echo "have_function_relative_LINENO is: ${have_function_relative_LINENO-UNSET}"
# echo "midline is: ${midline-UNSET}"
# : ${midline+}			# this should be a complete no-op, and IS
# midline=${midline-0}	  # More serious workaround for the Bash 2.05b bug.

## Another set of debugging output as well as a test case.  The
## output is fascinating; the first line printed is blank and the
## second one printed is the string "0"; in a working shell, both
## lines would be "0".
# set +o nounset
# echo $midline
# echo $midline
# set -o nounset

## WORKAROUND:
## This should be a no-op.  However, this works around the Bash 2.05b bug where
## it thinks midline is unset.
# echo ${midline-UNSET} > /dev/null		# "echo" fails miserably.
builtin echo ${midline-UNSET} > /dev/null
# Also problems with this one.  This one, too, breaks in bad places.
builtin echo ${have_function_relative_LINENO-UNSET} > /dev/null

## POSSIBLE FUTURE WORKAROUND:
## # Do the same thing for the other global variables that are set inside 
## # libjconfigure.bash, just in case the Bash bug should manifest
## # itself again:  

## Place where source files reside.
checkenv RVM_ROOT

## Place where RVM bootimage, booter, and runtime support files will be placed.
checkenv --may-not-exist RVM_BUILD

## What configuration will host the build process?
checkenv RVM_HOST_CONFIG

## What configuration will run the system?

    ${PAGER=more} <<- EOF
	Usage: ${ME} [flags]... <configuration-name>
	Usage: ${ME} -help

	Flags: 
	-nocleanse | -cleanse :
	  (Do not) throw away intermediate files in the build directory that 
          were generated during a previous run of ${ME}.  "-cleanse" is the 
	  default.  Has no effect if run on a build directory that has never
	  been used for building.  This is only useful if you know that you
	  haven't changed the build configuration.
	  
	-quiet :
	  Do not spit out (most of) the informative messages that go out during
	  a run of ${ME}.  This includes possible complaints if you're
	  running an old version of Bash.

	[-D <variable>=<value>]... :
	  This flag may be repeated an arbitrary number of times.  Sets configuration
	  variables that describe the kind of Jikes RVM you are trying to build.
	  Provides an alternative to writing configuration files just 
	  to change one or two variables.

	About ${ME}:
	This script generates control files necessary to build a
	particular "configuration" of the Research Virtual Machine.
	
	Normally it is invoked as:
	
	   $ME <configuration-name>
	
	Where <configuration-name> indicates the configuration to be
	created and an environment variable, \$RVM_BUILD, specifies a
	directory where files comprising the configuration are to be
	placed.
	
	We normally do not request warnings from the C, C++, and Java
	compilers.  

	If you want to see C and C++ warnings, edit the
	RVM_TARGET_CONFIG and RVM_HOST_CONFIG files, setting CC to
	something like "gcc \$CFLAGS" and CPLUS to something like 
	"g++ \$CXXFLAGS".  *Then* set the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment
	variables before you invoke "jconfigure", or invoke jconfigure
	with the -DCFLAGS and -DCXXFLAGS options.

	If you want to see Java warnings, set the values of
	JAVAC_WARNING_FLAGS and JIKES_WARNING_FLAGS with -D
	in the arguments to jconfigure.  The default value for both
	is "-nowarn".

	You can invoke this script as "${ME} < /dev/null" in order to
	suppress interactive questions.

	This script creates the \$RVM_BUILD directory and populates it
	with a skeleton directory structure along with some scripts
	and control files.

	After running this script, you can build an RVM executable by typing:
	
	    cd \$RVM_BUILD
	    ./jbuild
	
	Your \$RVM_ROOT tree will be template-expanded,
	macro-processed, compiled, and linked into a bootimage.  The
	processed sources, class files, bootimage, and booter will be
	placed into the \$RVM_BUILD directory.
	
	To execute the resulting bootimage (from any directory), type:
	
	   rvm <vm-flags> classname <application-args>
	
	Later, if you make changes to your \$RVM_ROOT tree, type
	"jbuild" again.  Modified source files will be discovered,
	copied to the build directory, recompiled, and the bootimage
	will be rebuilt.
	
	Special Cases when running "jbuild"
	===================================
	
	To avoid unnecessarily rebuilding the bootimage (when, for
	example, you have only modified classes that are dynamically
	loaded and which are not part of the bootimage) type "jbuild
	-nolink".
	
	To avoid building the booter (when, for example, running on
	the AIX side of an AIX/Linux cross-compilation) type "jbuild
	-nobooter".
	
	To build only the booter (when, for example, running on Linux
	side of a cross-port to Linux) type "jbuild -booter".
	
	To force recompilation of all classes (when, for example,
	you have modified a global constant or have added/removed
	fields/methods from a class) type "jbuild -recompile".
	
	To restore the build directory to its original "unbuilt" state
	type "jbuild -clean".
	
	To monitor the build process in more detail type "jbuild
	-trace".  "jbuild -help" will print the suboptions to
	"-trace", and may also print information about other options
	to jbuild.
	
	To monitor the build in even more detail, "jbuild" will pass
	on the flag "-demographics" to the boot image writer.  This
	makes the boot image writer display a summary of how the boot
	image's space is used up.

	If you want to pass additional options to the boot compiler
	(the compiler used when the Boot Image Writer compiles the
	boot image), then you can set these at configuration time by
	running "jconfigure" with the OPT_ARGS variable set, like so:

	     -DOPT_ARGS="-X:bc:opt1=val1 -Xbc:opt2=val2..."

	You can also set boot compiler options at build time by
	setting the environment variable DEBUG_ARGS, like so:

	     export DEBUG_ARGS="-X:bc:opt3=val3 -Xbc:opt4=val4..."
	or:
	     setenv DEBUG_ARGS "-X:bc:opt3=val3 -Xbc:opt4=val4..."

	before you invoke "jbuild".
