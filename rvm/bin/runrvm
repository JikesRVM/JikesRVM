# Invoke the Jikes RVM virtual machine that "jbuild" created.
# See also: $RVM_ROOT/rvm/bin/jconfigure -help

# This file, 'runrvm', is the old (as of Sept. 2002) 'rvm' script,
# except the variables are specified using parameters instead of
# environment variables.  'rvm' passes parameters to 'runrvm', using
# values defined by environment variables.

# 'runrvm' must be an executable program; 
# the Eclipse Jikes RVM Launcher Plugin expects this.
