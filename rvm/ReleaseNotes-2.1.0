This is release 2.1.0 of the Jikes RVM. This release 
provides some significant refactoring and new functionality,
as well as bug fixes.

IMPORTANT: new prerequisite!  The Jikes RVM now requires 
JazzLib.  (TODO: update this with appropriate text).

IMPORTANT NOTE: We are aware of a bug in the IBM DK for 
  Linux/IA32 v1.3.1 when building Jikes RVM.  Stick with 
  version v1.3.0 until this bug can be resolved.

Highlights of this release include:
 - Introduction of a plug-in parameterized object model, as
   described in the ECOOP 2002 paper by Bacon, Fink & Grove. 
   The MarkSweep configurations now have a one-word header
   for most objects.  All configurations now use 32-bit 
   address-based hashing.
 - Introduction of a "magic" VM_Address type, representing 
   a raw address manipulated by the VM.  Currently both 
   platforms implement VM_Address as an unsigned 
   32-bit integer.
 - Significant refactoring of the memory management system,
   to reduce replicated code and support more functionality.
 - Signficant refactoring of the VM interface to the 
   standard libraries, introducing the 
   com.ibm.JikesRVM.librarySupport package to help porting
   to use another standard library implementation.
 - The original PowerPC linear scan implementation is 
   deleted, and the new IA32 linear scan implementation 
   has been refactored and ported to support both IA32 and 
   PowerPC.
 - The optimizing compiler now inlines trivial callees even
   at optimization level zero.
 - Significant improvements in speed of the optimizing 
   compiler's register allocation and Heap Array SSA 
   construction phases.
 - Some more support for miscellaneous library functions
   including class loaders and some system services.
 - Miscellaneous enhancements to JDP.
 - Support for reading/using Soot-style class file annotations.
 - Elimination of the classloading lock (VM_ClassLoader.lock).

To see more details on other miscellaneous bug fixes, see
the developerWorks bug tracking software tool and CVS 
history.  The following bugs in version 2.0.3 are 
fixed in 2.1.0:

 2794: Classes resolved but not in boot image
 2806: IA32: genThreadSwitchTest for deterministic thread
       switching
