This is release 2.3.0 of the Jikes RVM. 

There are a number of major changes and significant improvements in
overall system stability and functionality since Jikes RVM 2.2.2. 

Highlights of this release include:
 + Now using classpath version 0.06
   - lots of improved functionality in classpath
   - fixes several critical defects in Jikes RVM
 + Build process:
   - ksh has been replaced with bash
   - improved robustness and error detection in all build tools
 + GC/Memory management:
   - MarkSweep and CopyMS Plans are considered stable
   - CopyMS is now recommended as the default memory manager
   - heapsize dynamically grows/shrinks based on utilization and load
   - implementation of soft, weak, and phantom references from Chris Hoffman
   - numerous bug fixes and performance improvements
   - numerous code cleanups from Robin Garner and Andrew Grey.
 + Simplified configuration of Jikes RVM
   - Added 4 logical configs to help new users pick a 'good' one
   - All builds with opt compiler use adaptive system
 + Baseline compiler is re-entrant; parallel baseline compilation enabled
 + Some progress on port to 64 bit PowerPC
    - Numerous code cleanups
    - More use of VM_Address, VM_Word, etc.
    - Complete reimplementation of syscalls (see VM_SysCall)
 + Includes 9 user contributions since 2.2.2;

Other notes:

We fixed all Javadoc warnings in the source code. 

VM_Time.now() replaced by VM_Time.cycles(). Internal interval timing 
should now be done using hardware cycle counters (VM_Time.cycles)
instead of getting the time of day. VM_Time.currentTimeMicros() can be
used to get the same functionality as VM_Time.now(), but is less
efficient than VM_Time.cycles().

A number of other miscellaneous bugs in version 2.2.2
are fixed in the 2.3.0 release.  See the developerWorks bug 
tracking software tool and CVS history for details.


Expansions of some of the highlights listed above:

+ Classpath 0.06 
  Although many programs may still work with Jikes RVM 2.3.0 and 
  GNU classpath 0.05 we strongly recommend switching to classpath 0.06. 
  We no longer test Jikes RVM with classpath 0.05.

+ logical configurations
  There are a large number of possible Jikes RVM configurations.
  Therefore we define four ``logical'' configurations that are most
  suitable for casual or novice users of the system. 
  The mapping of logical to actual configurations may vary from release
  to release.  In particular, it is expected that the choice of garbage
  collector for these logical configurations may be different as JMTk
  evolves. The four configurations are: 
  (1) prototype 
      A simple, fast to build, but low performance configuration of
      Jikes RVM.   This configuration does not include the
      optimizing compiler or adaptive system.  Most useful for rapid
      prototyping of the core virtual machine.
  (2) prototype-opt
      A simple, fast to build, but low performance configuration of 
      Jikes RVM.  Unlike prototype, this configuration does
      include the optimizing compiler and adaptive system. Most useful
      for rapid prototyping of the core virtual machine, adaptive
      system, and optimizing compiler. 
  (3) development 
      A fully functional configuration of Jikes RVM with reasonable 
      performance that includes the adaptive system and optimizing
      compiler. This configuration takes longer to build than the two 
      prototype configurations.
  (4) production 
      The same as the development configuration, except all assertions
      are disabled.  This is the highest performance configuration of 
      Jikes RVM and is the one to use for benchmarking and
      performance analysis. Build times are similar to the development
      configuration. 

+ Jikes RVM's Java preprocessor documented, and more robust:
  The preprocessor is now documented, both in the User's Guide and via a
  --help option.  It is also a lot more robust than it used to be.
  We wrote up-to-date documentation for the preprocessor.  We also fixed
  some deficiencies where certain errors in using the preprocessor would
  lead to silent failures.  The preprocessor was generating incorrect
  exit status codes under some failure conditions; these are fixed.  All
  buffer overflows are now caught and fixed.  All GCC warnings fixed in
  the preprocessor.

  The preprocessor now notices incorrect syntax (extra trailing
  characters after a conditional) and correctly complains about it.

  The preprocessor now handles failures and fatal signals by
  conservatively deleting the output file in progress.  This keeps us
  from having half-updated files sitting around.

+ improvements in build process to make it stop on errors:
  Any error occurring during a build of Jikes RVM now cause the build
  process to immediately abort.  We had, in the past, at least twice a
  month received reports that a built RVM failed to work, where upon
  investigation we discovered that the build process had encountered
  errors earlier, and these earlier errors were the real source of the
  problem.

+ ksh => bash
  Jikes RVM's build process is now entirely free of KSH.  This makes it
  more convenient for Linux users to install the system.
