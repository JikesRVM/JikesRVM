/**
 * The timer thread.  Although we are using purely native threading, threads
 * need to occasionally be poked for the purposes of sampling and OSR.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that the implementation of this class prioritizes
 * unobtrusiveness and lock-freedom over precision.  For example, on any given
 * timer release some threads may be missed or poked more than once, with the
 * understanding that if they are missed on one release then they will (with
 * high probability) not be missed on a future release.
 * <p>
 * It may be that to make the system scale, more than one timer thread will
 * be needed.  But for now, this should suffice.
