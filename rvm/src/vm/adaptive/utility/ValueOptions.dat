V INITIAL_SAMPLE_SIZE int 20
Initial value of how many samples to take before reporting method hotness to controller


V MAX_OPT_LEVEL int 2
What is the highest optimization level to use when adaptive recompilation is employed?


V FILTER_OPT_LEVEL int 2
At what optimization level should we begin to NOT return to methods to the controller


E PRIMARY_STRATEGY byte PS_ADAPTIVE
Selection of primary controller strategy
"PS_BASE_ONLY baselineOnly baseonly" \

Name of log file


V COMPILER_DNA_FILE_NAME String \"CompilerDNA.txt\" dna
Name of compiler DNA file


V LOGGING_LEVEL int 1
Control amount of event logging (larger ==> more)


V FINAL_REPORT_LEVEL int 0
Control amount of info reported on exit (larger ==> more)


V SAMPLE_FREQ_MILLIS double 10.0
Sample frequency, in milliseconds


V DECAY_FREQUENCY int 100

V AI_METHOD_HOTNESS_THRESHOLD double 0.0025
What fraction (0.0 to 1.0) of total method samples makes a callee hot enough to consider for recompilation to inline a hot non-inlined call edge?


V MAX_EXPECTED_AI_BOOST double 3.0
How much more effective do we expected an optimization level to be if boosted by adaptive inlining?
