Jikes RVM NEWS -- History of significant changes

This file contains the release notes since Jikes RVM 2.0.0, released
on October 14, 2001,

*Jikes RVM 2.3.7 Release Notes (future...)

*Highlights 
** OS X is working again.

** Major MMTk Refactoring.
The most significant refactoring to MMTk since the initial release has 
been completed. The MMTk Plan class hierarchy has been split to more 
clearly distinguish global and local state, and move toward a more natural 
Java style. This has involved substantial changes to the plan hierarchy,
which is now structured a set of subpackages under org.mmtk.plan. For more 
information on the MMTk refactoring please refer to the tutorial and 
cheatsheet in the MMTk/doc directory, both of which are intended to 
assist with users migrating collectors to the new release.

*Jikes RVM 2.3.6 Release Notes (released on May 23, 2005)

*Highlights 
** Just like 2.3.5, this release of Jikes RVM does not work on OSX.  
If you use Jikes RVM on OSX please help us fix it so subsequent
releases will support OSX again.

**The recommended version of GNU classpath for Jikes RVM 2.3.6 is 0.15.
Classpath 0.14 is expected to still work.  
Some older versions of classpath (0.10 and higher) might still work, 
but have not been tested.  
Subsequent releases of Jikes RVM will remove support for all versions of 
GNU classpath prior to 0.15.

** We have fixed defect 1189786 which represented a significant regression in 
Jikes RVM 2.3.5. 

** After source code cleanups, most jikes warnings are now enabled by default. 



*Jikes RVM 2.3.5 Release Notes (released on April 8, 2005)
*Highlights 
** This release of Jikes RVM does not work on OSX.  
If you use Jikes RVM on OSX please help us fix it so subsequent
releases will support OSX again.

**The recommended version of GNU classpath for this release of Jikes RVM is 0.14.  
Furthermore, all of the configuration logic that controls classpath
version has been moved to $RVM_ROOT/rvm/config/classpath-version.  We
suggest you may want to modify your local configuration files to source
this file, to make it easier to track changes in classpath version
across releases of Jikes RVM. 

**We can build with Jikes versions 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and CVS Head.

**We detect the version of the Jikes compiler in use and print warning
messages if that version has not been tested.

**Quick Compiler (missing from the original 2.3.4 release notes)
Release 2.3.4 marked the first public appearance 
of the "Quick" compiler for the PowerPC architecture targets.

The Quick compiler is supposed to be rather smarter than the Base 
compiler about register use without being nearly as complex as the Opt 
compiler.

Rather smarter means that stack and local variables are kept in 
registers if possible, not in memory.

Not nearly as complex means, for instance, that the Quick compiler code 
generator works in a single pass, with no intermediate representations. 
Right now the only additional optimizations are to remember if stack or 
local variable values are already in a temporary or work register and 
hence don't need to be loaded, and to postpone local variable stores 
until it becomes obvious that the value really needs to be written.

One purpose of the Quick compiler is to explore how close to the 
performance of the Opt compiler we can come by using just the most 
beneficial optimizations. Also, we hope to use it as a starting point 
for experimenting with other optimizations without having to deal with 
the implementation details of the Opt compiler and the complex 
interactions among the many optimizations performed by the Opt compiler.

*Other Notes:
**We've moved to http://jikesrvm.sourceforge.net.  
We'll try to update the documentation, but please point out anything
that we missed.

**The release notes are now in a file called NEWS instead of 
the old ReleaseNotes-<revision-number> files.  Further, NEWS is an
archive; it is contains release notes for all open source versions of
Jikes RVM.

**The java.version system property is now at 1.4.2 
(This is missing from the original 2.3.4 release notes)

Claiming to be at java.version 1.4.2 is a lie, of course -- we don't
really support all 1.4 features, such as assertions.  However, it is a
necessary lie, since Eclipse 3.0 explicitly tests java.version and
insists upon at least 1.4.1 to run.

Similarly, java.specification.version is up to 1.4 and
java.vm.version is at 1.4.2.

*Bug Fixes:
**The problems with timezones that several users have reported with the change to daylight savings times and Jikes RVM 2.3.4/classpath 0.12 are not a problem in Jikes RVM 2.3.5/classpath 0.14. 
**Calling VM.sysFail during boot image writing no longer generates a bogus "vm internal error" message.
***VM_Scheduler.traceback and VM_Scheduler.dumpStack now work properly
even when Jikes RVM is writing the boot image.  This, in turn, means
that we no longer generate internal errors if we have to call
VM.sysFail during boot image writing time.



*Jikes RVM 2.3.4 Release Notes (released December 21, 2004)
THe following four sections of the document contain the Jikes RVM
2.3.4 release notes.  They are:
**Highlights
**Other Notes
**Bug Fixes
**Internal Changes

*Highlights of the Jikes RVM 2.3.4 release:

**We now run Eclipse 3.0
You can use Jikes RVM to run Eclipse 3.0; this lets you run a free
IDE with a free VM.

**The port to PowerPC64 is virtually complete.  There are a few fringe opt 
compiler bugs remaining, but functionality has advanced to the point where 
development and production images of Jikes RVM are passing almost all 
regression tests. 

**MMTk has been moved out of $RVM_ROOT/rvm/src/vm/memory managers to 
$RVM_ROOT/MMTk.  It has also been reorganized to have the directory structure
match its package structure and thus is "Eclipse-friendly."  MMTk's
option parsing has been rewritten.  There are other internal 
changes as well.

**Major revision of the object model. All objects (arrays and scalars) 
are now layed out in a "forwards" direction. This simplifies and enables
many common GC techniques (scannable heap; card-marking) at the cost of a 
slight performance hit on AIX/PowerPC due to the need to make some null checks
explicit. See VM_ObjectModel.java for more details. 

**XML parsing with Xalan
Jikes RVM can now be configured so it always uses the Xalan XML
parser.  See the configuration file variable XALAN_J_DIR.

**We have switched to GNU Classpath version 0.12.
Versions 0.10 and 0.11 can still be used, if you set appropriate
options in the configuration file, but we recommend Classpath 0.12.

**CPU hogging fixed
Jikes RVM used to busy-wait when it was idle, waiting for I/O or
timeouts.  It now sleeps properly, which is nice if you're trying
to do something else on your workstation at the same time that you're
using Jikes RVM.  This closes long-standing defect # 2046.

*Other Notes for the Jikes RVM 2.3.4 release:
**The memory size options now all take sizes in bytes by default.  (INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE)
They used to use a mix of default units: Megabytes (Mebibytes),
Kilobytes (Kibibytes), and "Log 2 of the frequency (in bytes)".  They
now all default to bytes; please update any scripts you have
appropriately.  This affects -Xmx, -Xms, and the -X:gc:* options. 

**The MMAP_COPY_ON_WRITE feature now works on PowerPC/Linux and PowerPC/OSX.  
(This feature was discussed in the 2.3.3 release notes.)

**The AttachCurrentThread JNI function is now partly implemented;
it now works in the common case where a thread is already attached to the VM.

**RVM_BOOTCLASSPATH_APPEND is a new environment variable that Jikes RVM
will recognize when booting.  You can use it to add extensions to the
VM.  Set it just as you would set the CLASSPATH environment variable.

**Major re-implementation of AOS's feedback-directed inlining and the opt 
compiler's default inlining policy. Result is simpler code, lower
overhead profiling, and more effective inlining decisions. 

*Bug Fixes in the Jikes RVM 2.3.4 release:
**The JNI AttachCurrentThread function now returns proper error status if it
cannot complete properly.  It used to (incorrectly) always return
JNI_OK.
**Class.getResourceAsStream() and Class.getResource() would fail 
with a NullPointerException when invoked on a Class object that was
loaded by the Bootstrap Class Loader. 
**Defect #3601 is fixed -- java.lang.Thread no longer inherits from VM_Thread.
**Stack trace printing for trouble in the boot thread is fixed; 
it no longer inappropriately elides frames.

*Internal Changes in the Jikes RVM 2.3.4 relesae:
**The VM_Magic classes have been moved to the org.vmmagic namespace, 
and rationalized. Further work on refactoring magic usage (mainly in Jikes 
RVM as opposed to MMTk) is ongoing.




*Jikes RVM 2.3.3 release notes sections
The following three sections of the document contain the Jikes RVM
2.3.3 release notes.  They are:
**Highlights
**Other Notes
**Bug Fixes

*Highlights of the Jikes RVM 2.3.3 release include:

**GNU Classpath 0.10
Jikes RVM now uses GNU Classpath version 0.10 on all platforms.  Jikes
RVM 2.3.3 should work with classpath version 0.08, 0.09 or 0.10.
However, we recommend that users switch to classpath 0.10, to get the
new features and because we run our nightly regression tests against
Classpath 0.10.

(If hand-building GNU Classpath 0.10 or 0.09 on AIX, follow the
directions in rvm/doc/classpath-0.10-on-AIX.txt)

**GCspy garbage collection visualization tool

Jikes RVM now includes support for the GCspy tool for visualizing the
garbage collector's behaviour.  Many thanks to Richard Jones of the
University of Kent for this contribution.  (This item should have been
included in the 2.3.2 release notes, but was inadvertently omitted.)
Documentation is in the user's guide.

**PowerPC/Linux/64 support with baseline compiler
Jikes RVM now runs on 64-bit PowerPC Linux to the same extent as it
does on 64-bit PowerPC AIX.  All regression tests pass with the
baseline compiler.  Porting of the opt compiler to 64 bit PowerPC is
an open work item; contributions welcome!

**Startup time slashed
The startup time for Jikes RVM to run a simple "Hello World" program
on Linux/x86 went down by a factor of 8.  This is because we now use
mmap()'s copy-on-write feature, instead of reading all 30 MB of boot
image into an area mmap()'d with MAP_ANONYMOUS.
(There is a long comment in src/tools/bootImageRunner/IA32/libvm.C
describing this; search for the preprocessor condition #ifdef
MMAP_COPY_ON_WRITE).  If this creates problems, disable them by
#undefining MMAP_COPY_ON_WRITE in libvm.C.  

This change should be ported to PowerPC Linux by someone who runs that
platform.

**Jikes RVM installable as a production runtime environment
You can install Jikes RVM on your system as a production runtime
environment for Java.  Once you've built Jikes RVM, cd to
src/tools/install and read the file README to find out how to
install a Jikes RVM executable as /usr/bin/rvm (or in some other
location of your choice). 

**JNI 1.2 and 1.4 implemented
We have implemented all of the missing functions from JNI 1.2 and 1.4.
There are still aspects of the JNI implementation that can be
improved; volunteers welcome.

**MMTk
Improvements to write barrier implementation, cleanup to mechanisms
for specifying alignment constraints in allocation code, and
refactoring of reference processing (java.lang.ref.*).

*Other Notes for the Jikes RVM 2.3.3 release:

**Compiler DNA updated -- x86 adaptive system now uses Opt level O2 sometimes.
The compiler DNA (the precomputed cost & benefit of using various
compiler/optimization levels) has been updated.  Due to improvements
over the past 10 months, the optimizing compiler's level 2 is now
better than level 1, on average, on both platforms.  (Previously,
this was not the case on IA32.)  The result is that the adaptive
system may now choose to use Opt level 2 on some methods because
its model can now determine that it will sometimes be beneficial 
to do so. 

*Bug Fixes for the Jikes RVM 2.3.3 release:
** Calls to the JNI function pair 
GetPrimitiveArrayCritical/ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical can now be nested. 
** Fixed a bug in the GC map iterator code (both platforms) that was returning 
references multiple times in dynamic linking frames.
** Fixed a bug in the GC map iterator code on PPC that was failing to return 
spilled parameters in dynamic linking frames.




*Jikes RVM 2.3.2 release notes sections:
The following three sections of the document contain the Jikes RVM
2.3.2 release notes.  They are:
**Highlights
**Other Notes
**Bug Fixes

*Highlights of the Jikes RVM 2.3.2 release include:
** Jikes RVM 2.3.2 requires classpath 0.08. 

**64-bit port of baseline compiler and runtime system to PowerPC64/AIX is 
complete. We have been passing all regression tests on PPC64/AIX for
over a month. NOTE: porting of the optimizing compiler has not yet begun
(contributions/collaborations welcome) and therefore no configuration
with the optimizing compiler will work in 64 bit mode.

** The default GC plan for the prototype, prototype-opt, development, 
and production configurations has been changed from CopyMS to GenMS. 
GenMS is a generational collector with an Appel-style nursery and a 
mark-sweep mature space.

** Jikes RVM now runs on newer versions of Linux/PowerPC that store the 
pthread id in R2.  Building Jikes RVM with RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR=0
is reported to work on top of these newer Linux releases, which resolves a
long-standing limitation of Jikes RVM on Linux/PowerPC.

**Source Code editing support
There are now VIM and Emacs style files supporting the Jikes RVM coding
style for C, Java, and C++.  See rvm/etc/README.  (This should have
been in the 2.3.1 release announcement but was not.)

**You can build Jikes RVM entirely with free software tools
You can now build Jikes RVM using the Kaffe virtual machine.  Details
in the installation section in the user's guide. 

*Other Notes for the Jikes RVM 2.3.2 release:

**Performance improvements in VM_Memory copying routines used by 
System.arraycopy and copying GC resulted in 10% improvement in
SPECjbb2000 throughput. 

*Bug Fixes for the Jikes RVM 2.3.2 release:
** Fixed problems in alignment support in JMTk that were causing crashes
in GC on PowerPC/AIX when doubleword alignment of long[] and double[]
was enabled. This is a bug that was introduced in version 2.3.1 and is
fixed in 2.3.2.

** Fixed performance problem in profile-directed inlining where the 
AI Organizer forces recompilation of methods in an attempt to inline
runtime service routines that won't be inlined no matter how many
times we try.  Problem has always existed, but became much more severe
in 2.3.0 release when we disabled the inlining of allocation sequences
if the size of the object was not known at compile time.

** Fixed bug in which non-virtualizable interface calls where not being
considered as candidates for feedback-directed inlining.

** We now provide all of the mandatory system properties
for the Java 1.4.2 API.

** Fixed bug in which the time zone code always thought 
the user was on New York time. 

** We now can print a meaningful message when we get
an ErrorInInitializerError in the early stages of booting the VM
before it is able to load in new classes.  We had incorrectly left
ErrorInInitializerError out of the VM's list of boot classes.

** If an uncaught exception is thrown while booting, 
we no longer try to print to the uninitialized System.err stream.
That used to trigger a NullPointerException.




*Jikes RVM 2.3.1 Release Notes (released on December 10, 2003)
The following three sections of the document contain the Jikes RVM
2.3.1 release notes.  They are:
**Highlights
**Other Notes
**Bug Fixes

*Highlights of Jikes RVM 2.3.1 include:

**Mac OSX is now supported!  
Generously contributed by Chris Hoffman of the University of
Massachusetts (USA).
***Details:
If you want to build Jikes RVM for Mac OSX, you will need to patch
your copy (version 0.06 or better) of GNU Classpath with the patch
file located in etc/gnu-classpath-on-mac-osx.patch.

** Seven user contributions incorporated since 2.3.0
*** Contributions were improvements to JMTk from Robin Garner,  
port to OSX from Chris Hoffman, refCount coalescing extension from Ian
Warrington, bug fixes for the OSX port and opt compiler on PPC from
Alan Lawrence, implementation of -jar cmd line arg from Anders Biehl
Norgaard, and support for getting the classpath from CLASSPATH envar
from Philippe Faes.

** Switched to classpath 0.07
*** Classpath 0.06 is expected to also work with this release of Jikes RVM, 
but we recommend upgrading to the latest classpath release.

**Source Code editing support
There are now VIM and Emacs style files supporting the Jikes RVM coding
style for C, Java, and C++.  See rvm/etc/README.

**Build system improvements:
***If you run "jbuild" with --trace, 
you actually get all of the relevant shell commands printed out.

***Under jbuild --trace=make, whenever we change directories, we report it
This is parseable by Emacs's compilation-mode.  --trace=make is
enabled automatically by "--trace" without any arguments.

***More error-checking functionality added to the build system.  

***Cleaned up a couple of bogus warnings
one could get in some versions of the Bourne-Again Shell (Bash).

***We can make automatic binary installations of Jikes RVM
There's a new generated script, "$RVM_BUILD/jbuild.install", that does
this.  Handy way to save off a configuration that works before making
changes.  Also lets us make a binary distribution of Jikes RVM, should
it be desirable.

***New build options, JAVAC_WARNING_FLAGS and JIKES_WARNING_FLAGS
These variables replace the former hardcoded "-nowarn", and can be set
arbitrarily. They default to "-nowarn" for historical compatibility.
It means you can now get helpful warnings from the Java compiler.

**Improvements to automatic download of GNU Classpath libraries. 
***We now use wget to download a classpath release instead of doing a 
cvs checkout.  This avoids the problematic aclocal/autoconf/etc step
and means that automatic downloading should work for all users and is
now the recommended default. 

**Progress in PowerPC64 port: we can run hello world
***The Jikes RVM port to PPC64 has progressed to the point where a prototype 
configuration boots and can run many simple programs.
Getting this far requires that lots of things are working, so it is a
fairly significant step.  However, there is more work to do with
prototype and we haven't started work on the opt compiler. This is very
much a work in progress (and members of the community are encouraged
to help!).

*Other notes for Jikes RVM 2.3.1:

***We have fixed all C and C++ compiler warnings in the Linux/x86 source
code, under GCC 2.96, GCC 3.3, and GCC 3.3.1.  The only exception is
warnings from GCC 2.96 of the form:

        ihnpdsm.C:4942: warning: `unused' attribute ignored

They are benign; ignore them.

***__linuxsmp__ has now been officially exorcised from the source.

*Bug Fixes in Jikes RVM 2.3.1:

***Debugging output no longer can drift into InterfaceDeclarations.h;
GenerateInterfaceDeclarations.java takes a new "-out" option.

***--trace=preprocessor now lists all of the directories consistently.

***Cross-building from Linux to AIX now works better.
You can now set RVM_ROOT and RVM_BUILD to different values on the host
and the target machines.  
****Details:
If you don't have RVM_ROOT and/or RVM_BUILD set in your environment
when you run the booter on the target, then "jbuild -booter" will use
the (recorded) values from the host.  If you do have one or both of
them set, they'll be used as appropriate.

It is now the case that, when you run "jconfigure" and "jbuild", you
should have your PATH set so that there is some Bash version in it
somewhere under the name "bash".

*** Other misc bugs fixed as well; see the bug tracking software.




*Jikes RVM 2.3.0.1 Release Notes (released on September 3, 2003)
2.3.0.1 is minor release of Jikes RVM to fix a few regressions in Jikes
RVM 2.3.0.

(1) Fixed build on Linux/IA32 with RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR=1.

The following three sections of the document contain the Jikes RVM
2.3.2 release notes.  They are:
**Highlights
**Other Notes
**Bug Fixes




*Jikes RVM 2.3.0 Release Notes (released on August 28, 2003)
This is release 2.3.0 of the Jikes RVM. 

There are a number of major changes and significant improvements in
overall system stability and functionality since Jikes RVM 2.2.2. 

Highlights of this release include:
 + Now using classpath version 0.06
   - lots of improved functionality in classpath
   - fixes several critical defects in Jikes RVM
 + Build process:
   - ksh has been replaced with bash
   - improved robustness and error detection in all build tools
 + GC/Memory management:
   - MarkSweep and CopyMS Plans are considered stable
   - CopyMS is now recommended as the default memory manager
   - RefCount plan is functional (does not support finalization or parallel GC)
   - heapsize dynamically grows/shrinks based on utilization and load
   - implementation of soft, weak, and phantom references from Chris Hoffman
   - numerous bug fixes and performance improvements
   - numerous code cleanups from Robin Garner and Andrew Grey.
 + Simplified configuration of Jikes RVM
   - Added 4 logical configs to help new users pick a 'good' one
   - All builds with opt compiler use adaptive system
 + Baseline compiler is re-entrant; parallel baseline compilation enabled
 + includes Arnold and Ryder Instrumentation Sampling Framework (PLDI'01)
 + Some progress on port to 64 bit PowerPC
    - Numerous code cleanups
    - More use of VM_Address, VM_Word, etc.
    - Complete reimplementation of syscalls (see VM_SysCall)
 + Includes 9 user contributions since 2.2.2;

Other notes:

We fixed all Javadoc warnings in the source code. 

VM_Time.now() replaced by VM_Time.cycles(). Internal interval timing 
should now be done using hardware cycle counters (VM_Time.cycles)
instead of getting the time of day. VM_Time.currentTimeMicros() can be
used to get the same functionality as VM_Time.now(), but is less
efficient than VM_Time.cycles().

A number of other miscellaneous bugs in version 2.2.2
are fixed in the 2.3.0 release.  See the developerWorks bug 
tracking software tool and CVS history for details.


Expansions of some of the highlights listed above:

+ Classpath 0.06 
  Although many programs may still work with Jikes RVM 2.3.0 and 
  GNU classpath 0.05 we strongly recommend switching to classpath 0.06. 
  We no longer test Jikes RVM with classpath 0.05.

+ logical configurations
  There are a large number of possible Jikes RVM configurations.
  Therefore we define four ``logical'' configurations that are most
  suitable for casual or novice users of the system. 
  The mapping of logical to actual configurations may vary from release
  to release.  In particular, it is expected that the choice of garbage
  collector for these logical configurations may be different as JMTk
  evolves. The four configurations are: 
  (1) prototype 
      A simple, fast to build, but low performance configuration of
      Jikes RVM.   This configuration does not include the
      optimizing compiler or adaptive system.  Most useful for rapid
      prototyping of the core virtual machine.
  (2) prototype-opt
      A simple, fast to build, but low performance configuration of 
      Jikes RVM.  Unlike prototype, this configuration does
      include the optimizing compiler and adaptive system. Most useful
      for rapid prototyping of the core virtual machine, adaptive
      system, and optimizing compiler. 
  (3) development 
      A fully functional configuration of Jikes RVM with reasonable 
      performance that includes the adaptive system and optimizing
      compiler. This configuration takes longer to build than the two 
      prototype configurations.
  (4) production 
      The same as the development configuration, except all assertions
      are disabled.  This is the highest performance configuration of 
      Jikes RVM and is the one to use for benchmarking and
      performance analysis. Build times are similar to the development
      configuration. 

+ Jikes RVM's Java preprocessor documented, and more robust:
  The preprocessor is now documented, both in the User's Guide and via a
  --help option.  It is also a lot more robust than it used to be.
  We wrote up-to-date documentation for the preprocessor.  We also fixed
  some deficiencies where certain errors in using the preprocessor would
  lead to silent failures.  The preprocessor was generating incorrect
  exit status codes under some failure conditions; these are fixed.  All
  buffer overflows are now caught and fixed.  All GCC warnings fixed in
  the preprocessor.

  The preprocessor now notices incorrect syntax (extra trailing
  characters after a conditional) and correctly complains about it.

  The preprocessor now handles failures and fatal signals by
  conservatively deleting the output file in progress.  This keeps us
  from having half-updated files sitting around.

+ improvements in build process to make it stop on errors:
  Any error occurring during a build of Jikes RVM now cause the build
  process to immediately abort.  We had, in the past, at least twice a
  month received reports that a built RVM failed to work, where upon
  investigation we discovered that the build process had encountered
  errors earlier, and these earlier errors were the real source of the
  problem.

+ ksh => bash
  Jikes RVM's build process is now entirely free of KSH.  This makes it
  more convenient for Linux users to install the system.  

+ The optimizing compiler now contains an implementation of the
  Instrumentation Sampling Framework from the Arnold and Ryder PLDI'01
  paper.    This infrastructure can be used to reduce the overhead of
  collecting profiling information using instrumentation.   For details,
  see the user guide section "Using the Jikes RVM to Profile an
  Application -> Instrumentation Sampling Framework."



*Jikes RVM 2.2.2 Release Notes (released on June 6, 2003)
This is release 2.2.2 of the Jikes RVM. 

Highlights of this release include:
  + Support for the hybrid library configuration has been
    removed and the library support code refactored to simplify
    the interface between the GNU Classpath libraries and Jikes RVM.
  + Defect 3383 has been resolved.  We now recomend using the 
    Blackdown 1.4.1 SDK to build Jikes RVM on Linux/IA32 and the 
    IBM 1.4 SDK to build Jikes RVM on AIX/PowerPC.
  + PowerPC hardware performance monitor tracing support for
    multiprocessors on AIX 5.
  + Work has stated on a port of Jikes RVM to 64 bit PowerPC. 
    This release includes a number of source code cleanups 
    (some complete, other still in progress) to make the system portable
    across 32 and 64 bit systems.  
  + A major rewrite of the PowerPC baseline compiler to enable it to
    generate code for both 32 and 64 bit PowerPC. As part of the redesign,
    the use of an explict SP register was eliminated and all accesses to 
    the expression stack are done by computing offsets from the FP at 
    compile time. 
    NOTE: The 64 bit PowerPC version of the baseline compiler 
    is very much a work in progress and is NOT expected to work in this 
    release.
  + Magic class (VM_AddressArray, etc) were added to enable arrays of 
    addresses to be safely created.  The classloader was enhanced to 
    treat VM_Address etc as primitive types.
  + Changed PowerPC version of VM_Assembler.java to uniformly use PowerPC 
    mnemonics for the instructions. 
  + The OutOfMemoryError exception is now thrown by the GC system.

Other notes:
  + Changes to configuration files:
        added MAXIMUM_MAPPABLE_ADDRESS and dropped the "" from 
        BOOTIMAGE_LOAD_ADDRESS
  + sysCalls were moved from VM to VM_SysCall.  Naming conventions were 
    changed to make parameter/return types explicit in name.
  + a number of obsolete command line arguments were removed. 
    Do rvm -help and rvm -X to see the current set of supported options.

A number of other miscellaneous bugs in version 2.2.1
are fixed in the 2.2.2 release.  See the developerWorks bug

*Jikes RVM 2.2.1 Release Notes (released on April 7, 2003)
This is release 2.2.1 of the Jikes RVM. 
This release includes several major pieces of new 
functionality and a number of bug fixes.

Highlights of this release include:
  + Jikes RVM is now based entirely on the GNU Classpath libraries.  
    The prior hybrid library solution is still supported in
    this release, but will be removed in subsequent releases. 
    See the userguide for details on how to build with the hybrid libraries.
  + Jikes RVM can run a significant subset of the Eclipse IDE.
  + Separate name spaces for classloaders.
  + Implementation of JNI for Linux/PowerPC.
  + The addition of an on-stack replacement mechanism to
    enable the adaptive system transfer execution from long-running 
    baseline compiled frames and to recover from speculative 
    optimizations.  More details can be found in a CGO 2003 paper.
  + Extensions for PowerPC hardware performance counters on AIX 5.

Other notes:
  + Future release of Jikes RVM will not support using the OTI 
    class libaries.
  + We continue to anticipate moving completely to JMTk and removing 
    support for the watson collectors in a future release of Jikes RVM.
    This should happen in the 2.2.2 release depending on the 
    performance of the JMTk MarkSweep collector.

A number of other miscellaneous bugs in version 2.2.0
are fixed in the 2.2.1 release.  See the developerWorks bug 
tracking software tool and CVS history for details.


*Jikes RVM 2.2.0 Release Notes (released on December 17, 2002)
This is release 2.2.0 of the Jikes RVM. 
This release includes several major pieces of new 
functionality and a number of bug fixes.

Highlights of this release include:
  + Jikes RVM now mostly uses the GNU Classpath class 
    libraries. All library packages except java.lang, 
    java.lang.ref, java.lang.reflect, java.io, java.net, 
    and java.util are from Classpath. 
    We are optimistic that release 2.2.1 of Jikes RVM will
    be based entirely on the GNU Classpath libraries.  
  + The introduction of JMTk (Java Memory management Tool kit).
  + Numerous extensions and bug fixes to core VM functionality
    to support running a wider range of applications.
  + Support for gathering and exploiting dynamic 
    branch probabilities for conditional and multi-way branches.
  + Introduction of packages in the Jikes RVM source code.
  + A bytecode verifier contributed by L. Zhang (UCSB)
  + Support for Intel cycle counter contributed by 
    H. Lee and J. Palm (Colorado)
  + Support for PowerPC hardware performance counters on AIX 5.

Other notes:
  + As announced in the 2.1.1 release notes support for 
    VM_Magic.pragmaInline and VM_Magic.pragmaNoInline 
    has been removed.  Code must use the exception-based 
    pragma mechanism.
  + jdp is no longer supported. See the userguide for details.
  + We anticipate moving completely to JMTk and removing support
    for the watson collectors in a future release of Jikes RVM.
    This may happen as soon as the 2.2.1 release depending on JMTk 
    performance and stability.

A large number of other miscellaneous bugs in version 2.1.1 
are fixed in the 2.2.0 release.  See the developerWorks bug 
tracking software tool and CVS history for details.


*Jikes RVM 2.1.1 Release Notes (released on July 2, 2002)
This is release 2.1.1 of the Jikes RVM. The main purpose of
this release is bug fixes.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We are aware of a bug in the IBM DK for 
  Linux/IA32 v1.3.1 when building Jikes RVM.  Stick with 
  version v1.3.0 until this bug can be resolved.

Highlights of this release include:
 - Introduction of a new method-level runtime exception 
   pragma mechanism, contributed by Chapman Flack.  The 
   system now relies on this mechanism for method-level 
   pragmas for uninterruptibility and inlining directives.
 - Restructuring of baseline compiler to increase the 
   amount of platform-independent shared code.
 - Stricter enforcement of uninterruptibility rules.
 - Improvements to SSA optimization package to reduce 
   register pressure.  These changes make O2 profitable
   for use by the adaptive system on IA32.
 - The VM_CompilerInfo classes were folded into the 
   VM_CompiledMethod classes. 

NOTE: VM_Magic.pragmaInline and VM_Magic.pragmaNoInline 
are deprecated, and will not be supported in the 2.1.2 
release.  Migrate code to use the new runtime exception
pragma mechanism.

To see more details on other miscellaneous bug fixes, see
the developerWorks bug tracking software tool and CVS 
history.  The following bugs in version 2.1.0 are 
fixed in 2.1.1: 
  2094: PPC: frem and drem incorrect
  2104: don't put <clinit> method for bootimage classes 
        in bootimage
  2916: Race condition: installing code and invalidation 
        of speculative opts
  2938: jazzlib documentation in userguide
  2949: OptAdaptive hangs on SPECjbb2000
  2988: VM_Lock.allocate can result in threadswitch


*Jikes RVM 2.1.0 Release Notes (released on June 10, 2002)
This is release 2.1.0 of the Jikes RVM. This release 
provides some significant refactoring and new functionality,
as well as bug fixes.

IMPORTANT: new prerequisite!  The Jikes RVM now requires 
  JazzLib. The jconfigure script will download it automatically.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We are aware of a bug in the IBM DK for 
  Linux/IA32 v1.3.1 when building Jikes RVM.  Stick with 
  version v1.3.0 until this bug can be resolved.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The concurrent collector is no longer 
  functional in Jikes RVM 2.1.0.

Highlights of this release include:
 - Introduction of a plug-in parameterized object model, as
   described in the ECOOP 2002 paper by Bacon, Fink & Grove. 
   The MarkSweep configurations now have a one-word header
   for most objects.  All configurations now use 32-bit 
   address-based hashing.
 - Introduction of a "magic" VM_Address type, representing 
   a raw address manipulated by the VM.  Currently both 
   platforms implement VM_Address as an unsigned 
   32-bit integer.
 - Significant refactoring of the memory management system,
   to reduce replicated code and support more functionality.
 - Signficant refactoring of the VM interface to the 
   standard libraries, introducing the 
   com.ibm.JikesRVM.librarySupport package to help porting
   to use another standard library implementation.
 - The original PowerPC linear scan implementation is 
   deleted, and the new IA32 linear scan implementation 
   has been refactored and ported to support both IA32 and 
   PowerPC.
 - The optimizing compiler now inlines trivial callees even
   at optimization level zero.
 - Significant improvements in speed of the optimizing 
   compiler's register allocation and Heap Array SSA 
   construction phases.
 - Some more support for miscellaneous library functions
   including class loaders and some system services.
 - Miscellaneous enhancements to JDP.
 - Support for reading/using Soot-style class file annotations.
 - Elimination of the classloading lock (VM_ClassLoader.lock).

To see more details on other miscellaneous bug fixes, see
the developerWorks bug tracking software tool and CVS 
history.  The following bugs in version 2.0.3 are 
fixed in 2.1.0: 
 2128: getMostRecentlyGeneratedCompilerInfo
 2359: update RunSanityTests default
 2739: static synchronized methods in boot image
 2763: jdp 'thread' command broken
 2772: IA32: problems with physical registers in LIR
 2794: Classes resolved but not in boot image
 2806: IA32: genThreadSwitchTest for deterministic thread
       switching
 2823: VM_Lister of CMPXCHG
 2831: BaseBase GC Map bug for Native Bridge


*Jikes RVM 2.0.3 Release Notes (released on March 11, 2002)
This is release 2.0.3 of the Jikes RVM. The main purpose
of this release is bug fixes.

Highlights include:
  -- Linux/IA32 jdp improvements including: many bug 
     fixes for BaseOpt and OptOpt bootimages; requiring 
     hex values to be prefixed with '0x' or '0X'; 
     clarifications in the help messages and userguide; 
     stepline command fixed for BaseBase builds; print 
     variable-name command fixed for BaseBase when 
     LoadLocalVariableTable is true. jdp still works
     better with BaseBase builds. 
  -- Regression tests now have test-specific timeout 
     values
  -- Improvements in opt's code placement phase:
       (1) callee's with pragmaNoInline are marked 
           as infrequent
       (2) uses dominator information to propagate 
           infrequency
  -- Code cleanups in opt compiler's LIR: 
       (1) constant materialization delayed until 
           translation to LIR
       (2) REF_ operators maintained through LIR.
  -- Backpatching-based dynamic linking eliminated 
     from baseline PPC; table-based dynamic linking now 
     used by all compilers on all platforms.
  -- Updated compiler DNA values for both AIX/PPC and 
     Linux/IA32; these values are used by the adaptive 
     system's cost/benefit model.

To see more details on other miscellaneous bug fixes, see
the developerWorks bug tracking software tool and CVS 
history.  The following bugs in version 2.0.2 are 
fixed in 2.0.3: 
   2526: Invalid ref reported while scanning stack 
         (BaseBaseSemispace)
   2585: IA32 baseline compiler - pragmaInline warnings 
         unreachable
   2586: VM_EdgeListener.update not thread safe
   2594: Method.getParameterTypes() doesn't resolve 
         returned classes
   2616: LINTEL: bad GC map on SPECjbb2000
   2623: Array index out of bounds in 
         OPT_ShortArrayReplacer
   2629: Null Ptr exception in adaptive code using a 
         saved cmid
   2664: Reflective operations on primitive types
   2665: GC points moving into uninterruptible regions
   2719: Threads on IO queue can starve
   2736: java.lang.Math.random is not properly initialized 
         in boot image


*Jikes RVM 2.0.2 Release Notes (released on January 17, 2002)
This is release 2.0.2 of the Jikes RVM. The main purposes
of this release are bug fixes, performance improvements for 
IA32, and minor improvements to the build process.  

Important:
  Starting in the 2.0.2 release, jconfigure now requires that 
  your RVM_TARGET_CONFIG file defines preprocessor directives 
  that specify the target architecture, operating system, and 
  whether or not your pthread library can support JikesRVM.  
  See the sample files in $RVM_ROOT/rvm/config. 
  Set RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR as follows:
    -- AIX/PowerPC:    0 (SMP is supported)
    -- Linux/PowerPC:  1 (SMP is not supported)
    -- Linux/IA32:     1 with a 2.2 kernel (SMP is not supported)
                       0 with a 2.4 kernel and glibc compiled to 
                         use the GS segment register to access
                         pthread-specific state. 
                
Highlights include:
  -- Improved IA32 performance (15% on specJVM98)
  -- Change in IA32 register convention to make EBP 
     a nonvolatile regster (RVM 2.0.2 does not use a 
     register to hold the framepointer on IA32).
  -- Simple static splitting transformation to create 
     intraprocedural hot traces based on static infrequent bit
  -- Redundant conditional branch elimination based on
     global value numbers and dominator information.
  -- Code-patch guard for guarded inlining (IA32 only).
  -- Adaptive configurations now GC dead code.
  -- Baseline compiler now recognizes some options. See -X:base
  -- Some improvements to speed of building bootImage
  

To see more details on other miscellaneous bug fixes, see
the developerWorks bug tracking software tool.  
The following bugs in version 2.0.1 are fixed in 2.0.2:
  -- 2035 LINTEL: clear FP state when delivering an exception
  -- 2044 LINTEL: VM_Magic.resumeThreadExecution
  -- 2126 LINTEL: RegisterOperands in memory operands
  -- 2368 LINTEL: FastBaseBaseSemispace build takes forever
  -- 2391 Expression Folding Fast image bug
  -- 2412 JVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR does not compile

  -- 2493 Cross-platform linux builds broken
  -- 2501 race condition in VM_Type.getClassForType
  -- 2543 Large (>512M) large heap crash
  -- miscellaneous latent bugs with SSA construction after CFG transformations


*Jikes RVM 2.0.1 Release Notes (released on November 14, 2001)
This is release 2.0.1 of the Jikes RVM. The main purposes
of this release are bug fixes, performance improvements for 
IA32, and improvements to the build process.  

Highlights include:

  - Linux/IA32 SMP (pthreads) support on Linux 2.4. 
    (Handling for threads that are stuck in native code
    is not fully supported on Linux at this time.)    
  - Improved IA32 floating-point instruction selection in 
    optimizing compiler.
