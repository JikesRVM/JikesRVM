# This file contains error and warning messages related to XPath Error Handling.
# Many of the messages are referenced by integer value (to avoid more strings
# in the class files) and the string keys formed at runtime.  In the case where
# the key is an integer, the constant reference (that would be used in the code)
# is listed in a comment above the tuple.

#  1) Xalan (or more properly, Xalan-interpretive) and XSLTC are names of
#     components.
#     XSLT is an acronym for "XML Stylesheet Language: Transformations".
#     XSLTC is an acronym for XSLT Compiler.
#
#  2) A stylesheet is a description of how to transform an input XML document
#     into a resultant XML document (or HTML document or text).  The
#     stylesheet itself is described in the form of an XML document.
#
#  3) A template is a component of a stylesheet that is used to match a
#     particular portion of an input document and specifies the form of the
#     corresponding portion of the output document.
#
#  4) An element is a mark-up tag in an XML document; an attribute is a
#     modifier on the tag.  For example, in <elem attr='val' attr2='val2'>
#     "elem" is an element name, "attr" and "attr2" are attribute names with
#     the values "val" and "val2", respectively.
#
#  5) A namespace declaration is a special attribute that is used to associate
#     a prefix with a URI (the namespace).  The meanings of element names and
#     attribute names that use that prefix are defined with respect to that
#     namespace.
#
#  6) "Translet" is an invented term that describes the class file that
#     results from compiling an XML stylesheet into a Java class.
#
#  7) XPath is a specification that describes a notation for identifying
#     nodes in a tree-structured representation of an XML document.  An
#     instance of that notation is referred to as an XPath expression.
#
#  8) The context node is the node in the document with respect to which an
#     XPath expression is being evaluated.
#
#  9) An iterator is an object that traverses nodes in the tree, one at a time.
#
#  10) NCName is an XML term used to describe a name that does not contain a
#     colon (a "no-colon name").
#
#  11) QName is an XML term meaning "qualified name".
