/**
 * This class implements the global state of a simple reference counting
 * collector.
 *
 * All plans make a clear distinction between <i>global</i> and
 * <i>thread-local</i> activities, and divides global and local state
 * into separate class hierarchies.  Global activities must be
 * synchronized, whereas no synchronization is required for
 * thread-local activities.  There is a single instance of Plan (or the
 * appropriate sub-class), and a 1:1 mapping of PlanLocal to "kernel
 * threads" (aka CPUs or in Jikes RVM, VM_Processors).  Thus instance
 * methods of PlanLocal allow fast, unsychronized access to functions such as
 * allocation and collection.
 *
 * The global instance defines and manages static resources
 * (such as memory and virtual memory resources).  This mapping of threads to
 * instances is crucial to understanding the correctness and
 * performance properties of MMTk plans.
