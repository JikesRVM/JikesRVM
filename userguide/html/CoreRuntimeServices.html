 id="x17-16900014"></a>Core Runtime Services</h2>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The Jikes RVM runtime environment implements a variety of services which a Java
application relies upon for correct execution. The services include:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><a 
href="#x17-17000014.1">Object Model</a>: The way objects are represented in storage.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><a 
href="#x17-17400014.2">Class   and   Code   Management</a>:   The   mechanism   for   loading,   and
     representing  classes  from  class  ﬁles.  The  mechanism  that  triggers
     compilation and linking of methods and subsequent storage of generated
     code.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><a 
href="#x17-18300014.3">Thread      Management</a>:      thread      creation,      scheduling      and
     synchronization/exclusion
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><a

     <li class="itemize"><a

     Java execution environment</li></ul>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >The requirement for many of these runtime services is clearly visible in language
primitives such as <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">new()</span></span></span>, <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">throw()</span></span></span> and in <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">java.lang</span></span></span> and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">java.io</span></span></span> APIs such as
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

class="cmtt-10">System.println()</span></span></span>, <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">File.open()</span></span></span> etc. Unlike conventional Java APIs
which merely modify the state of Java objects created by the Java application,
implementation of these primitives requires interaction with and modiﬁcation of the
platform (hardware and system software) on which the Java application is being
executed.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >In addition to the services described above, Jikes RVM also provides some services
that are speciﬁc to its purpose as a research tool: </p>

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >An object model dictates how to represent objects in storage; the best object model
will maximize eﬃciency of frequent language operations while minimizing storage
overhead. Jikes RVM&#x2019;s object model is deﬁned by ObjectModel.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x17-17100014.1.1"></a>Overview</h4>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Values in the Java<span 
class="tcrm-1000">™ </span>programming language are either <span 
class="cmti-10">primitive </span>(e.g. <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">int</span></span></span>, <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">double</span></span></span>,
etc.) or they are <span 
class="cmti-10">references </span>(that is, pointers) to objects. Objects are either <span 
class="cmti-10">arrays</span>
having elements or <span 
class="cmti-10">scalar </span>objects having ﬁelds. Objects are logically composed of two
primary sections: an object header (described in more detail below) and the object&#x2019;s
instance ﬁelds (or array elements).
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The following non-functional requirements govern the Jikes RVM object model:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">instance ﬁeld and array accesses should be as fast as possible,
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">null-pointer checks should be performed by the hardware if possible,
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">method dispatch and other frequent runtime services should be fast,
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">other (less frequent) Java operations should not be prohibitively slow, and
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">per-object storage overhead (ie object header size) should be as small as
     possible.</li></ul>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >Assuming the reference to an object resides in a register, compiled code can access
the object&#x2019;s ﬁelds at a ﬁxed displacement in a single instruction. To facilitate
array access, the reference to an array points to the ﬁrst (zeroth) element
of an array and the remaining elements are laid out in ascending order.
The number of elements in an array, its <span 
class="cmti-10">length</span>, resides just before its ﬁrst
element. Thus, compiled code can access array elements via base + scaled index
addressing.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >The Java programming language requires that an attempt to access an object
through a null object reference generates a <span 
class="cmtt-10">NullPointerException</span>. In Jikes RVM,
references are machine addresses, and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">null</span></span></span> is represented by address 0. On Linux,
accesses to both very low and very high memory can be trapped by the hardware,
thus all null checks can be made implicit.

</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x17-17200014.1.2"></a>Object Header</h4>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >Logically, every object header contains the following components: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">textbfTIB Pointer: The TIB (Type Information Block) holds information
     that applies to all objects of a type. The structure of the TIB is deﬁned by
     <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">TIBLayoutConstants</span></span></span>. A TIB includes the virtual method table, a pointer
                                                                  

                                                                  
     to an object representing the type, and pointers to a few data structures
     to facilitate eﬃcient interface invocation and dynamic type checking.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">textbfHash  Code:  Each  Java  object  has  an  identity  hash  code.  This
     can  be  read  by  <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Object.hashCode()</span></span></span> or  in  the  case  that  this  method
     was overridden, by <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">System.identityHashCode</span></span></span>. The default hash code is
     usually the location in memory of the object, however, with some garbage
     collectors objects can move. So the hash code remains the same, space in
     the object header may be used to hold the original hash code value.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">textbfLock: Each Java object has an associated lock state. This could be
     a pointer to a lock object or a direct representation of the lock.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">textbfArray  Length:  Every  array  object  provides  a  length  ﬁeld  that
     contains the length (number of elements) of the array.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">textbfGarbage Collection Information: Each Java object has associated
     information  used  by  the  memory  management  system.  Usually  this
     consists  of  one  or  two  mark  bits,  but  this  could  also  include  some
     combination of a reference count, forwarding pointer, etc.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">textbfMisc Fields: In experimental conﬁgurations, the object header can
     be expanded to add additional ﬁelds to every object, typically to support
     proﬁling.</li></ul>
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >An implementation of this abstract header is deﬁned by two ﬁles: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">JavaHeader</span></span></span>, which supports TIB access, default hash codes, and locking.
     It also provides a few bits for use by the memory management subsystem.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MiscHeader</span></span></span>, which supports adding additional ﬁelds to all objects.</li></ul>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Information that is speciﬁc to garbage collection uses the available bits from the Java
header. Depending on the chosen garbage collector, the available bits can be accessed
via an appropriate class, e.g.: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">HeaderByte</span></span></span> which provides access to methods for logging and unlogging
     for various collectors
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RCHeader</span></span></span> for reference counting garbage collectors
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">ForwardingWord</span></span></span> which provides methods for object forwarding which is
     used by some copying collectors</li></ul>

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x17-17300014.1.3"></a>Field Layout</h4>
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >Fields tend to be recorded in the Java class ﬁle in the order they are declared in the
Java source ﬁle. We lay out ﬁelds in the order they are declared with some exceptions
to improve alignment and pack the ﬁelds in the object.
</p><!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >Fields of type <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">double</span></span></span> and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">long</span></span></span> beneﬁt from being 8 byte aligned. Every
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMClass</span></span></span> records the preferred alignment of the object as a whole. We lay out
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">double</span></span></span> and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">long</span></span></span> ﬁelds ﬁrst (and object references if these are 8 bytes long) so
that we can avoid making holes in the ﬁeld layout for alignment. We don&#x2019;t
do this for smaller ﬁelds as all objects need to be a multiple of 4 bytes in
size.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >When we lay out ﬁelds we may create holes to improve alignment. For example, an
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">int</span></span></span> following a <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">byte</span></span></span>, we&#x2019;ll create a 3 byte hole following the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">byte</span></span></span> to keep the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">int</span></span></span> 4
byte aligned. Holes in the ﬁeld layout can be 1, 2 or 4 bytes in size. As ﬁelds are laid
out, holes are used to avoid increasing the size of the object. Sub-classes inherit the
hole information of their parent, so holes in the parent object can be reused by their
children.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.2   </span> <a 
 id="x17-17400014.2"></a>Class and Code Management</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The runtime maintains a database of Java instances which identiﬁes the currently
loaded class and method base. The classloader class base enables the runtime to
identify and dynamically load undeﬁned classes as they required during execution.
All the classes, methods and compiled code arrays required to enable the runtime to
operate are pre-installed in the initial boot image. Other runtime classes and
application classes are loaded dynamically as they are needed during execution and
have their methods compiled lazily. The runtime can also identify the latest compiled
code array (and, on occasions, previously generated versions of compiled code) of any
given method via this classbase and recompile it dynamically should it wish to do
so.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Lazy method compilation postpones compilation of a dynamically loaded class&#x2019;
methods at load-time, enabling partial loading of the class base to occur. Immediate
compilation of all methods would require loading of all classes mentioned in the
bytecode in order to verify that they were being used correctly. Immediate
compilation of these class&#x2019; methods would require yet more loading and so on until
the whole classbase was installed. Lazy compilation delays this recursive
class loading process by postponing compilation of a method until it is ﬁrst
called.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Lazy compilation works by generating a stub for each of a class&#x2019; methods when the
class is loaded. If the method is an instance method this stub is installed in the
appropriate TIB slot. If the method is static it is placed in a linker table located in
the JTOC (linker table slots are allocated for each static method when a class is
dynamically loaded). When the stub is invoked it calls the compiler to compile the
method for real and then jumps into the relevant code to complete the call. The
compiler ensures that the relevant TIB slot/linker table slot is updated with
the new compiled code array. It also handles any race conditions caused by
                                                                  

                                                                  
concurrent calls to the dummy method code ensuring that only one caller
proceeds with the compilation and other callers wait for the resulting compiled
code.

<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Regardless of whether or not a virtual method is overridden, virtual method dispatch
is still simple since the method will occupy the same TIB oﬀset its deﬁning class and
in every sub-class. However, a method invoked through an <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">invokeinterface</span></span></span> call
rather than an <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">invokevirtual</span></span></span> call, will not occupy the same TIB oﬀset
in every class that implements its interface. This complicates dispatch for
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">invokeinterface</span></span></span>.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >The simplest, and least eﬃcient way, of locating an interface method is to search all
the virtual method entries in the TIB ﬁnding a match. Instead, Jikes RVM uses an
<span 
class="cmti-10">Interface Method Table (IMT) </span>which resembles a virtual method table for
interface methods. Any method that could be an interface method has a ﬁxed
oﬀset into the IMT just as with the TIB. However, unlike in the TIB, two
diﬀerent methods may share the same oﬀset into the IMT. In this case, a
<span 
class="cmti-10">conﬂict resolution stub </span>is inserted in the IMT. Conﬂict resolution stubs are
custom-generated machine code sequences that test the value of a hidden
parameter to dispatch to the desired interface method. For more details, see

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >This section provides some explanation of how Java<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">TM</span></sup> threads are scheduled and
synchronized by Jikes<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">TM</span></sup> RVM.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >All Java threads (application threads, garbage collector threads, etc.) derive from
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread</span></span></span>. Each <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread</span></span></span> maps directly to one native thread, which may be
implemented using whichever C/C++ threading library is in use (currently either
pthreads or Harmony threads). Unless <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">-X:availableProcessors</span></span></span> or <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">-X:gc:threads</span></span></span>
is used, native threads are allowed to be arbitrarily scheduled by the OS using
whatever processor resources are available; Jikes<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">TM</span></sup> RVM does not attempt to
control the thread-processor mapping at all.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Using native threading gives Jikes<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">TM</span></sup> RVM better compatibility for existing JNI
code, as well as improved performance, and greater infrastructure simplicity.
Scheduling is oﬄoaded entirely to the operating system; this is both what
native code would expect and what maximizes the OS scheduler&#x2019;s ability to
optimally schedule Java<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">TM</span></sup> threads. As well, the resulting VM infrastructure
is both simpler and more robust, since instead of focusing on scheduling
decisions it can take a ”hands-oﬀ” approach except when Java threads have
to be preempted for sampling, on-stack-replacement, garbage collection,
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Thread.suspend()</span></span></span>, or locking. The main task of <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread</span></span></span> and other code in
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">org.jikesrvm.scheduler</span></span></span> is thus to override OS scheduling decisions when the VM
demands it.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The remainder of this section is organized as follows. The management of a thread&#x2019;s
state is discussed in detail. Mechanisms for blocking and handshaking threads are
described. The VM&#x2019;s internal locking mechanism, the Monitor, is described. Finally,
the locking implementation is discussed.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x17-18400014.3.1"></a>Tracking the Thread State</h4>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >The state of a thread is broken down into two elements: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Should the thread yield at a safe point?
                                                                  

                                                                  
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Is the thread running Java code right now?</li></ul>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >The ﬁrst mechanism is provided by the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread.takeYieldpoint</span></span></span> ﬁeld, which is <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">0</span></span></span>
if the thread should not yield, or non-zero if it should yield at the next safe point.
Negative versus positive values indicate the type of safe point to yield at
(epilogue/prologue, or any, respectively).
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >But this alone is insuﬃcient to manage threads, as it relies on all threads
being able to reach a safe point in a timely fashion. New Java threads may
be started at any time, including at the exact moment that the garbage
collector is starting; a starting-but-not-yet-started thread may not reach a safe
point if the thread that was starting it is already blocked. Java threads may
terminate at any time; terminated threads will never again reach a safe point.
Any Java thread may call into arbitrary JNI code, which is outside of the
VM&#x2019;s control, and may run for an arbitrary amount of time without reaching
a Java safe point. As well, other mechanisms of <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread</span></span></span> may cause a
thread to block, thereby making it incapable of reaching a safe point in a
timely fashion. However, in each of these cases, the Java thread is ”eﬀectively
safe” - it is not running Java code that would interfere with the garbage
collector, on-stack-replacement, locking, or any other Java runtime mechanism.
Thus, a state management system is needed that would notify these runtime
services when a thread is ”eﬀectively safe” and does not need to be waited
on.
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >RVMThread provides for the following thread states, which describe to other runtime
services the state of a Java thread. These states are designed with extreme care to
support the following features: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Allow Java threads to either execute Java code, which periodically reaches
     safe points, and native code which is ”eﬀectively safe” by virtue of not
     having access to VM services.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Allow   other   threads   (either   Java   threads   or   VM   threads)   to
     asynchronously request a Java thread to block. This overlaps with the
     takeYieldpoint mechanism, but adds the following feature: a thread that
     is ”eﬀectively safe” does not have to block.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Prevent race conditions on state changes. In particular, if a thread running
     native code transitions back to running Java code while some other thread
     expects it to be either ”eﬀectively safe” or blocked at a safe point, then
     it should block. As well, if we are waiting on some Java thread to reach a
     safe point but it instead escapes into running native code, then we would
     like to be notiﬁed that even though it is not at a safe point, it is now
     eﬀectively safe, and thus, we do not have to wait for it anymore.</li></ul>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >The states used to put these features into eﬀect are listed below. </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">NEW</span></span></span>. This means that the thread has been created but is not started, and
     hence is not yet running. <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">NEW</span></span></span> threads are always eﬀectively safe, provided
     that they do not transition to any of the other states.
                                                                  

                                                                  
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_JAVA</span></span></span>. The thread is running Java code. This almost always corresponds
     to the OS ”runnable” state - i.e. the thread has no reason to be blocked, is
     on the runnable queue, and if a processor becomes available it will execute,
     if it is not already executing. <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_JAVA</span></span></span> thread will periodically reach safe
     points at which the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">takeYieldpoint</span></span></span> ﬁeld will be tested. Hence, setting
     this ﬁeld will ensure that the thread will yield in a timely fashion, unless
     it transitions into one of the other states in the meantime.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_NATIVE</span></span></span>. The thread is running either native C code, or internal VM
     code (which, by virtue of Jikes<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">TM</span></sup> RVM&#x2019;s metacircularity, may be written
     in Java). <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_NATIVE</span></span></span> threads are ”eﬀectively safe” in that they will not do
     anything that interferes with runtime services, at least until they transition
     into some other state. The <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_NATIVE</span></span></span> state is most often used to denote
     threads that are blocked, for example on a lock.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_JNI</span></span></span>.  The  thread  has  called  into  JNI  code.  This  is  identical  to
     the  <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_NATIVE</span></span></span> state  in  all  ways  except  one:  <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_JNI</span></span></span> threads  have
     a  JNIEnvironment  that  stores  more  information  about  the  thread&#x2019;s
     execution state (stack information, etc), while <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_NATIVE</span></span></span> threads save
     only the minimum set of information required for the GC to perform stack
     scanning.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_JAVA_TO_BLOCK</span></span></span>. This represents a thread that is running Java code,
     as  in  <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_JAVA</span></span></span>,  but  has  been  requested  to  yield.  In  most  cases,  when
     you set <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">takeYieldpoint</span></span></span> to non-zero, you will also change the state of
     the thread from <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_JAVA</span></span></span> to <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">IN_JAVA_TO_BLOCK</span></span></span>. If you don&#x2019;t intend on
     waiting for the thread (for example, in the case of sampling, where you&#x2019;re
     opportunistically requesting a yield), then this step may be omitted; but
     in the cases of locking and garbage collection, when a thread is requested
     to yield using <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.3.2   </span> <a 
 id="x17-18500014.3.2"></a>Blocking and Handshaking</h4>
<!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >Various VM services, such as the garbage collector and locking, may wish to request
a thread to block. In some cases, we want to block all threads except for the thread
that makes the request. As well, some VM services may only wish for a ”soft
handshake”, where we wait for each non-collector thread to perform some action
                                                                  

                                                                  
exactly once and then continue (in this case, the only thread that blocks is the
thread requesting the soft handshake, but all other non-collector threads must
”yield” in order to perform the requested action; in most cases that action is
non-blocking). A uniﬁed facility for performing all of these requests is provided by
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread</span></span></span>.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >Four types of thread blocking and handshaking are supported: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread.block()</span></span></span>.  This  is  a  low-level  facility  for  requesting  that  a
     particular thread blocks. It is inherently unsafe to use this facility directly
     - for example, if thread <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">A</span></span></span> calls <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">B.block()</span></span></span> while thread <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">B</span></span></span> calls <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">A.block()</span></span></span>,
     the two threads may mutually deadlock.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread.beginPairHandshake()</span></span></span>.
     This implements a safe pair-handshaking mechanism, in which two threads
     become bound to each other for a short time. The thread requesting the
     pair handshake waits until the other thread is at a safe point or else is
     ”eﬀectively safe”, and prevents it from going back to executing Java code.
     Note that at this point, neither thread will respond to any other handshake
     requests until <span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread.endPairHandshake() </span>is called. This is useful
     for implementing biased locking, but it has general utility anytime one
     thread needs to manipulate something another thread&#x2019;s execution state.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread.softHandshake()</span></span></span>.  This  implements  soft  handshakes.  In
     a  soft  handshake,  the  requesting  thread  waits  for  all  non-collector
     threads  to  perform  some  action  exactly  once,  and  then  returns.  If
     any  of  those  threads  are  eﬀectively  safe,  then  the  requesting  thread
     performs  the  action  on  their  behalf.  <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">softHandshake()</span></span></span> is  invoked
     with  a  <span 
class="cmtt-10">SoftHandshakeVisitor </span>that  determines  which  threads  are
     to  be  aﬀected,  and  what  the  requested  action  is.  An  example  of
     how  this  is  used  is  found  in  <span 
class="cmtt-10">org.jikesrvm.mm.mmtk.Collection </span>and
     <span 
class="cmtt-10">org.jikesrvm.compilers.opt.runtimesupport.OptCompiledMethod</span>.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread.hardHandshakeSuspend()</span></span></span>. This stops all threads except for
     the  garbage  collector  threads  and  the  thread  making  the  request.
     It   returns   once   all   Java   threads   are   stopped.   This   is   used   by
     the  garbage  collector  itself,  but  may  be  of  utility  elsewhere  (for
     example,  dynamic  software  updating).  To  resume  all  stopped  threads,
     call <span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread.hardHandshakeResume()</span>. Note that this mechanism is
     carefully designed so that even after the world is stopped, it is safe to
     request a garbage collection (in that case, the garbage collector will itself
     call a variant of <span 
class="cmtt-10">hardHandshakeSuspend()</span>, but it will only aﬀect the one
     remaining running Java thread).</li></ul>

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.3.3   </span> <a 
 id="x17-18600014.3.3"></a>The Monitor API</h4>
<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >The VM internally uses an OS-based locking implementation, augmented with
support for safe lock recursion and awareness of handshakes. The Monitor API
provides locking and notiﬁcation, similar to a Java lock, and may be implemented
using either a <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">pthread_mutex</span></span></span> and a <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">pthread_cond</span></span></span>, or using Harmony&#x2019;s monitor
API.
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >Acquiring a Monitor lock, or awaiting notiﬁcation, may cause the calling <span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread</span>
to block. This prevents the calling thread from acknowledging handshakes
until the blocking call returns. In some cases, this is desirable. For example:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">In the implementation of handshakes, the code already takes special care
     to use the <span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread </span>state machine to notify other threads that the caller
     may block. As such, acquiring a lock or waiting for a notiﬁcation is safe.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If acquiring a lock that may only be held for a short, guaranteed-bounded

<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >Jikes<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">TM</span></sup> RVM uses a hybrid thin/biased locking implementation that is designed for
very high performance under any of the following loads: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Locks only ever acquired by one thread. In this case, biased locking is
     used, an no atomic operations (like compare-and-swap) need to be used
     to acquire and release locks.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Locks acquired by multiple threads but rarely under contention. In this
     case, thin locking is used; acquiring and releasing the lock involves a fast
     inlined compare-and-swap operation. It is not as fast as biased locking on
     most architectures.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Contended locks. Under sustained contention, the lock is ”inﬂated” - the
     lock will now consist of data structures used to implement a fast barging
     FIFO  mutex.  A  barging  FIFO  mutex  allows  threads  to  immediately
     acquire the lock as soon as it is available, or otherwise enqueue themselves
     on a FIFO and await its availability.</li></ul>
<!--l. 157--><p class="noindent" >Thin locking has a relatively simple implementation; roughly 20 bits in the object
header are used to represent the current lock state, and compare-and-swap is used to
manipulate it. Biased locking and contended locking are more complicated, and are
described below.
</p><!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >Biased locking makes the optimistic assumption that only one thread will ever want
to acquire the lock. So long as this assumption holds, acquisition of the lock is a
simple non-atomic increment/decrement. However, if the assumption is violated (a
thread other than the one to which the lock is biased attempts to acquire the lock), a
fallback mechanism is used to turn the lock into either a thin or contended lock. This
works by using <span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread.beginPairHandshake() </span>to bring both the thread that is
requesting the lock and the thread to which the lock is biased to a safe point. No
other threads are aﬀected; hence this system is very scalable. Once the pair
handshake begins, the thread requesting the lock changes the lock into either
a thin or contended lock, and then ends the pair handshake, allowing the
thread to which the lock was biased to resume execution, while the thread
requesting the lock may now contend on it using normal thin/contended
mechanisms.
</p><!--l. 161--><p class="noindent" >Contended locks, or ”fat locks”, consist of three mechanisms:

<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >All of the 1.1 through 1.4 JNIEnv interface functions are implemented.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >The functions are deﬁned in the class <span 
class="cmtt-10">JNIFunctions</span>. Methods of this class are
compiled with special prologues/epilogues that translate from native calling
conventions to Java calling conventions and handle other details of the transition
related to threading. Currently the optimizing compiler does not support these
specialized prologue/epilogue sequences so all methods in this class are baseline
compiled. The prologue/epilogue sequences are actually generated by the
platform-speciﬁc <span

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.4.3   </span> <a 
 id="x17-19100014.4.3"></a>Invoking Native Methods</h4>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >There are two mechanisms whereby RVM may transition from Java code to native
code.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >The ﬁrst mechanism is when RVM calls a method of the class <span 
class="cmtt-10">SysCall</span>. The native
methods thus invoked are deﬁned in one of the C and C++ ﬁles of the JikesRVM
executable. These native methods are non-blocking system calls or C library
services. To implement a syscall, Jikes RVM compilers generate a call sequence
consistent with the platform&#x2019;s underlying calling convention. A syscall is not a
GC-safe point, so syscalls may modify the Java heap (eg. <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">memcpy()</span></span></span>). For more
details on the mechanics of adding a new syscall to the system, see the header
comments of <span 
class="cmtt-10">SysCall.java</span>. Note again that the syscall methods are NOT JNI
methods, but an independent (more eﬃcient) interface that is speciﬁc to Jikes
RVM.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >The second mechanism is JNI. Naturally, the user writes JNI code using the JNI
interface. RVM implements a call to a native method by using the platform-speciﬁc
<span 
class="cmtt-10">JNICompiler </span>to generate a stub routine that manages the transition between Java
bytecode and native code. A JNI call is a GC-safe point, since JNI code cannot freely
modify the Java heap.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.4.4   </span> <a

<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >See the <a 
href="#x17-18300014.3">Thread Management</a> subsection for more details on the thread system in
Jikes RVM.
</p><!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >There are two ways to execute native code: syscalls and JNI. A Java thread that calls
native code by either mechanism will never be preempted by Jikes RVM, but in the
case of JNI, all of the VM&#x2019;s services will know that the thread is ”eﬀectively safe”
and thus may be ignored for most purposes. Additionally, threads executing JNI code
                                                                  

                                                                  
may have handshake actions performed by other threads on their behalf, for example
in the case of GC stack scanning. This is not the case with syscalls. As far as
Jikes RVM is concerned, a Java thread that enters syscall native code is
still executing Java code, but will appear to not reach a safe point until
after it emerges from the syscall. This issue may be side-stepped by using
the <span 
class="cmtt-10">RVMThread enterNative() </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">leaveNative </span>methods, as shown in
<span 
class="cmtt-10">org.jikesrvm.runtime.FileSystem</span>.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.5   </span> <a 
 id="x17-19500014.5"></a>Exception Management</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The runtime has to deal with the relatively small number of hardware signals which
can be generated during Java execution. On operating systems other than AIX, an
attempt to dereference a <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">null</span></span></span> value (an access to a null value manifests
as a read to a small negative address outside the mapped virtual memory
address space) will generate a a segmentation fault. This means that the Jikes
RVM does not need to generate explicit tests guarding against dereferencing
null values and this results in faster code generationg for non-excepting
code.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The Jikes RVM handles the signal and reenters Java so that a suitable Java exception
handler can be identiﬁed, the stack can be unwound (if necessary) and the handler
entered in order to deal with the exception. Failing location of a handler, the
associated Java thread must be cleanly terminated.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >The Jikes RVM actually employs software traps to generate hardware exceptions in a
small number of other cases, for example to trap array bounds exceptions.
Once again a software only solution would be feasible. However, since a
mechanism is already in place to catch hardware exceptions and restore control
to a suitable Java handler the use of software traps is relatively simple to
support.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Use of a hardware handler enables the register state at the point of exception to be
saved by the hardware exception catching routine. If a Java handler is registered in
the call frame which generated the exception this register state can be restored before
reentry, avoiding the need for the compiler to save register state around potentially
excepting instructions. Register state for handlers in frames below the exception
frame is automatically saved by the compiler before making a call and so can
always be restored to the state at the point of call by the exception delivery
code.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >The bootloader registers signal handlers which catch <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">SEGV</span></span></span> and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">TRAP</span></span></span> signals. These
handlers save the current register state on the stack, create a special handler frame
above the saved register state and return into this handler frame executing
<span 
class="cmtt-10">RuntimeEntrypoints.deliverHardwareException()</span>. This method searches the
stack from the excepting frame (or from the last Java frame if the exception occurs
inside native code) looking for a suitable handler and unwinding frames which do not
contain one. At each unwind the saved register state is reset to the state associated
with the next frame. When a handler is found the delivery code installs the saved
register state and returns into the handler frame at the start of the handler
block.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >The Jikes RVM employs some of the same code used by the hardware exception
                                                                  

                                                                  
handler to implement the language primitive <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">throw()</span></span></span>. This primitive requires
a handler to be located and the stack to be unwound so that the handler
can be entered. A <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">throw</span></span></span> operation is always translated into a call to
<span 
class="cmtt-10">RuntimeEntrypoints.athrow() </span>so the unwind can never happens in the
handler frame. Hence the register state at the point of re-entry is always
saved by the call mechanism and there is no need to generate a hardware
exception.

 id="x17-19600014.6"></a>Bootstrap</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Jikes RVM is started up by a boot program written in C, the bootloader. The
bootloader is responsible for </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">registering signal handlers to deal with the hardware errors generated by
     Jikes RVM
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">establishing the initial virtual memory map employed by Jikes RVM
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">mapping the Jikes RVM image ﬁles

     the runtime to interact with the underlying operating system into the boot
     record of at the start of Jikes RVM image area
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">setting up the JTOC and TR registers for its RVMThread/pthread
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">switching the pthread into the bootstrap Java stack running the bootstrap
     Java method in the bootstrap Java thread</li></ul>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >At this point all further initialization of Jikes RVM is done either in Java or by
employing the wrapper callbacks located in the boot record.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >The initial bootstrap routine is <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">VM.boot()</span></span></span>. It sets up the initial thread environment
so that it looks like any other thread created by a call to <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Thread.start()</span></span></span> then
performs a variety of Java boot operations, including initialising the memory
manager subsystem, the runtime compiler, the system classloader and the time
classes.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >The bootstrap routine needs to rerun class initializers for a variety of the runtime
and runtime library classes which are already loaded and compiled into the image
ﬁle. This is necessary because some of the data generated by these initialization
routines will not be valid in the JIkes RVM runtime. The data may be invalid as the
host environment that generated the boot image may diﬀer from the current
environment.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >The boot process the enables the Java scheduler and locking system, setting up the
data structures necessary to launch additional threads. The scheduler also starts the
<span 
class="cmtt-10">FinalizerThread </span>and multiple garbage collector threads (i.e. multiple instances of
<span 
class="cmtt-10">CollectorThread</span>).
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Next, the boot routine boots the the JNI subsystem which enables calls to native
code to be compiled and executed then re-initialises a few more classes whose init
methods require a functional JNI (i.e. <span 
class="cmtt-10">java.io.FileDescriptor</span>).
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >Finally, the boot routine loads the boot application class supplied on the rvm
command line, creates and schedules a Java main thread to execute this class&#x2019;s main
method, then exits, switching execution to the main thread. Execution continues
until the application thread and all non-daemon threads have exited. Once there are
no runnable threads (other than system threads such as the idle threads, collector
threads etc) execution of the RVM runtime terminates and the rvm process
exits.

 id="x17-20800014.8"></a>VM Callbacks</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Jikes<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-9">TM</span></sup> RVM provides callbacks for many runtime events of interest to the Jikes
RVM programmer, such as classloading, VM boot image creation, and VM exit.
The callbacks allow arbitrary code to be executed on any of the supported
events.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The callbacks are accessed through the nested interfaces deﬁned in the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Callbacks</span></span></span> class.
There is one interface per event type. To be notiﬁed of an event, register an instance
of a class that implements the corresponding interface with <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Callbacks</span></span></span> by calling the
corresponding <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">add...()</span></span></span> method. For example, to be notiﬁed when a class is
instantiated, ﬁrst implement the <span 
class="cmtt-10">Callbacks.ClassInstantiatedMonitor </span>interface,
and then call <span 
class="cmtt-10">Callbacks.addClassInstantiatedMonitor() </span>with an instance of your
class. When any class is instantiated, the <span 
class="cmtt-10">notifyClassInstantiated </span>method in your
instance will be invoked.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >The appropriate interface names can be obtained by appending ”Monitor” to the
event names (e.g. the interface to implement for the MethodOverride event is
<span 
class="cmtt-10">Callbacks.MethodOverrideMonitor</span>). Likewise, the method to register the callback
is ”add”, followed by the name of the interface (e.g. the register method for the above
interface is <span 
class="cmtt-10">Callbacks.addMethodOverrideMonitor()</span>).
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Since the events for which callbacks are available are internal to the VM, there are
limitations on the behavior of the callback code. For example, as soon as the exit
callback is invoked, all threads are considered daemon threads (i.e. the VM will not
wait for any new threads created in the callbacks to complete before exiting). Thus,
if the exit callback creates any threads, it has to join() with them before
returning. These limitations may also produce some unexpected behavior.
For example, while there is an elementary safeguard on any classloading
callback that prevents recursive invocation (i.e. if the callback code itself
causes classloading), there is no such safeguard across events, so, if there are
callbacks registered for both ClassLoaded and ClassInstantiated events, and the
ClassInstantiated callback code causes dynamic class loading, the ClassLoaded
callback will be invoked for the new class, but not the ClassInstantiated
callback.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >Examples of callback use can be seen in the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
