# This configuration is the same as FullAdaptiveStickyMS with the
# important exception that we allow the image to be oversized. This
# allows us to get some testing until the image bloat issues (RVM-809)
# are solved. It also provides the possibilty to track the image size
# to determine how big the problem is.
config.allowOversizedImage=true

# The following should be the same as in FullAdaptiveStickyMS
