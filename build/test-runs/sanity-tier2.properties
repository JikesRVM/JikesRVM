# The sanity-tier2 test-run is the set of tests that really should be 
# in sanity, but aren't 100 stable yet.
# They are run as a secondary test-run when sanity is run by the nightly
# regression tests to reduce the noise in the main sanity run caused by 
# expected intermittent failures.

# sub-tests that are excluded because they cannot pass yet

# These tests test atomicity of accesses for volatile longs and doubles.
# Changes to make them pass for the baseline compilers are work in progress
# (see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/RVM-1019). No effort has been
# started for the opt compilers yet.
