## Jikes Research Virtual Machine

Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine) provides a flexible open testbed to prototype virtual machine technologies and experiment with a large variety of design alternatives. The system is licensed under the [EPL](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html), an [OSI](http://www.opensource.org/) approved license. Jikes RVM runs on IA32 32 bit (64 bit support is work in progress) and PowerPC (big endian only).

A distinguishing characteristic of Jikes RVM is that it is implemented in the Javaâ„¢ programming language and is self-hosted i.e., its Java code runs on itself without requiring a second virtual machine. Most other virtual machines for the Java platform are written in native code (typically, C or C++). A Java implementation provides ease of portability, and a seamless integration of virtual machine and application resources such as objects, threads, and operating-system interfaces.

More information is available at our [website](http://www.jikesrvm.org).

## Building

You'll need

* a JDK (>= 6)
* Ant (>= 1.7) with optional tasks
* GCC with multilibs
* Bison
* an internet connection during the first build to download [GNU Classpath](http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/) and other components

Please see the [user guide](http://www.jikesrvm.org/UserGuide/) for more details.

## Need support?

## Work based on Jikes RVM

For work based on Jikes RVM, see our [publications page](http://www.jikesrvm.org/Resources/Publications/). Bear in mind that this page is almost always incomplete. You can help rectify this by submitting pull requests or patches against the [website repository](https://github.com/JikesRVM/jikesrvm.github.io/). Additionally, some authors have decided to publish the code for their papers in the [research archive at Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/p/jikesrvm/research-archive/?limit=250).

## Other GitHub repositories that are based on Jikes RVM

There are a lot of projects on GitHub that are based on Jikes RVM but aren't forks of this repository. If you want your project listed (or not listed) here, please send us a patch or pull request.

The list is divided into repositories with code changes and additional information (description, README, paper, thesis, ...), repositories that have code changes but no (known) support material and repositories where it's unclear if there are actually any code changes against the base Jikes RVM.

Projects with code changes and additional information
* [HeraJVM](https://github.com/rmcilroy/HeraJVM), a JVM implementation for the Cell processor. See the thesis [Using program behaviour to exploit heterogeneous multi-core processors ](http://theses.gla.ac.uk/1755/) by Ross McIlroy or the paper "Hera-JVM: A Runtime System for Heterogeneous Multi-Core Architectures".
* [Metacircular Research Platform](https://github.com/codehaus/mrp) by Ian Rogers. We're trying to merge most of the changes from MRP, with the notable exception of Apache Harmony support (because it's dead upstream) and Windows support (because that is implemented with Apache Harmony in MRP). If you want to help, see the [MRP merge status page](http://www.jikesrvm.org/MergeStatusOfMRPChangesets/) and ask on the core mailing list first.
* [A mark-compact related GC implementation](https://github.com/ampasowa/jikesrvm)

* [Reference-counting Immix](https://github.com/rifatshahriyar/rcimmix) by Rifat Shahriyar et al. See the paper "Taking Off the Gloves with Reference Counting Immix" (OOPSLA'13). There's also a conservative version of the collector and an associated paper in OOPSLA'14. Patches to produce both collector implementations from a base Jikes RVM can be found in Rifat's [patch repository](https://github.com/rifatshahriyar/rcimmixpatch). If you want to help to get the code into mainline Jikes RVM, contact us on the core mailing list. The relevant issues are [RVM-1061](https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/browse/RVM-1061) for RCImmix and [RVM-1085](https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/browse/RVM-1085) for conservative RC Immix.
* [Sapphire garbage collector](https://github.com/perlfu/sapphire). See that repository's readme for more information. If you want to help get the collector into mainline, contact us on the core mailing list. The associated issue is [RVM-893](https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/browse/RVM-893).
