This directory holds scripts for:
1. Running the Dacapo benchmark for Vincent (run_vincent_experiment.sh)
2. Running baseline experiments (running Dacapo for unmodified JikesRVM)

Step 1. will produce heatmaps comparing the energy, time, and edp of Vincent compared to 
the conventional Linux CPU governors. 
So we need to run step 2 before we run Step 1.
